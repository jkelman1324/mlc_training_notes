# Medical Treatment Utilization Schedule (MTUS)

**MTUS...**

- Determines reasonable and necessary medical treatment for injured worker
- Determines which treatment requests will be approved
- Based on the principles of evidence-based medicine with care support by the best available evidence
- Treatment recommendations are presumed correct
- Now contains new and updated ACOEM treatment guidelines

## The MTUS: What? Why? Where and How?

### What is the MTUS?

- Establishes how reasonable and necessary medical treatment is determined
- Based on principles of evidence-based medicine
- MTUS - ACOEM guidlines are foundation
- Treatment recommendations presumed reasonable and necessary
- Use of recommendations conflicting with MTUS must be supported by better evidence
- UR and IMR physicians evaluate conflicting
- Following the Medical Evidence Search Sequence maximizes efficiency
- UR and IMR physicians apply a scientifically sound methodology to determine which recommendation is support by the best evidence
- Treatment recommendations supported by best available evidence will guide medical care

### Why is the MTUS important?

- Won't know how RFAs are being evaluated
  - Can be frustrating and cause treatment delays/denials
- Knowing MTUS allows effective communication with UR and IMR physicians

### MTUS-ACOEM Treatment Guidelines -- Overview

- DWC major overhaul of MTUS guidelines in 12/2017
- Only MTUS guidelines presumed reasonable and necessary
- All treatment guidelines adopted into MTUS from ACOEM
- Acupuncture and Postsurgical guidelines now subsumed into corresponding disorders guideline
- Workplace Mental Health Guideline has replaces Stress-Related Conditions Guideline

## Using the MTUS-ACOEM Guidelines for Patient Treatment

### Scenario #1 - Diagnosis and Treatment Plan

- Diagnosis
  - Low Back Pain, ICD-10 M54.5

  - Doctor's First Report (DFR) or Progress Report (PR-2)
  - Request for Authorization (RFA) form (Include all treatment requests)
  - With inadequate documentation, your treatment request could be denied even if your treatment plan is consistent with the MTUS-ACOEM guidelines

## The MTUS Formulary

### MTUS Drug List Evidence Base

- NOTE: Physician-administered drugs are not included on the MTUS Drug List
- Not a stand alone document, must be used in conjunction with the adopted MTUS-ACOEM Treatment guidelines
- Components
  - Drug ingredient
  - Brand example
  - Exempt/Non-Exempt
  - Special Fill+Peri-operative Fill
  - Drug Class
  - Reference in ACOEM Guidelines
  - Dosage Form
  - Strength
  - Unique Pharmaceutical Identifier(s)
- Exempt Drugs
  - May be provided w/o Prospective Review if in accordance with the MTUS-ACOEM Treatment Guidelines
  - Beneficial as these medications will be provided more quickly to the injured worker
  - 2 situations that may affect review status of exempt drug
    1. Providers dispensing medications should be familiar with provisions for physician-dispensed medications
    2. Anyone ordering a brand name product when a generic is available must follow additional requirements
  - Physician may dispense up to 7-day supply of Exempt drug if...
    - Drug is recommended in ACOEM guideline and,
    - Drug is dispensed at initial visit occurring within 7 days of injury
  - For Branded drugs, physician must document medical necessity, including patient-specific factors
- Non-Exempt Drugs
  - More likely used in chronic care phase, or
  - May have more risks associated with use
  - These drugs go through usual prospective UR process
  - Covered in MTUS-ACOEM guidelines, users may look for guidance there
- Unlisted Drugs
  - Drugs not included on the MTUS Drug List
  - All FDA approved drugs available
- Special Fill
  - Allows dispensing without prospective review
  - Drug must be identified as Special Fill eligible on MTUS Drug List

    - Supply does not exceed limit listed on MTUS Drug List
    - Must be generic if possible, otherwise document medical necessity for brand name drug
  - Anticoagulants, opioid analgesics, a muscle relaxant, and an anticonvulsant
- Spotlight on Acute Use of Opioids
  - Disturbing stats from Opioid Epidemic are well-known within our community
  - How do MTUS-ACOEM Guidelines handle acute use of opioids?
  - How does the MTUS use Special Fill provision to address opioid initial use?
- Additional Formulary Provisions
  - Waiver of prospective review
  - Treatment under California Health and Safety Regulations
  - Unique Pharmaceutical Identifier
  - Quarterly Updates to the MTUS Drug List
  - The formulary regulations also address:
    - the composition, role and function of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee
    - Physician-dispensed drugs
    - Use of Brand name products when generics are available
    - Compounded drug products
    - Off-label use of medications
    - Physician-administered drugs

## Use Recommendations Found Outside of the MTUS-ACOEM Guidelines for Patient Treatment

- 2 limited situations
  1. MTUS-ACOEM does not address patient's condition
  2. MTUS-ACOEM recommendations do not support desired treatment plan - CHALLENGE PRESUMPTIONS

## How Conflicting Recommendations are Evaluated by Utilization Review and Independent Medical Review Physicians

Determine if your treatment request is medically necessary.

- Conflicts

  1. When the _treatment_ you recommend is not supported by MTUS-ACOEM guideline
  2. When your patient's _condition_ is not covered by an MTUS-ACOEM guideline

- UR and IMR physicians required to...
  - Apply MTUS Methodology for Evaluating Medical Evidence when there are conflicting recommendations
  - Evaluate the quality and strength of the underlying studies used to support each recommendation to determine which is supported by the best available evidence
  - The recommendation supported by the best available evidence will then be used to determine the medical necessity of your requested treatment

### Applying the MTUS Methodology for Evaluating Medical Evidence

1. Determine the Quality

- Is study applicable?
- Is the study free from undue bias?
- If no, either the study does not apply or is unreliable because of bias

2. Determine the Strength of Evidence

- Apply the hierarchy of evidence (strongest to weakest)
  1. Systematic review of RCT's low risk of bias
  2. RCT's with low risk of bias
  3. One or more RCT's with identified risks of bias
  4. Non-randomized cohort studies that include controls
  5. Case-control studies or historically controlled studies
  6. Uncontrolled studies (case studies or case reports)
  7. Published expert opinion

### UR and IMR Decisions

- Physician reviewers should include...
  - Citation to the guideline or study
  - Level of evidence for each published study
  - If more than one citation, explain how each provides additional information not addressed in the primary
  - A statement that high levels of evidence are absent if relying on lower levels of evidence
