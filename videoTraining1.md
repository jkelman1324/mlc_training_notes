---

### Preparing for the Evaluation

- Steps before evaluation
  - Responsibility of parties to send cover letter and medical records
  - Follow up with parties
  - All issues in dispute must be addressed

- Anything in writing addressed to BOTH parties
- No requirement for records to be sent before evaluation
- Communication with Primary Treating Physician allowed
- Know the requirements for scheduling and providing the evaluation
- Appointment Notification and Cancellation
  - Send QME Form 110 within 5 business days of appointment
  - Indicate need for certified interpreter
  - Canceling not allowed less than 6 business days prior to appointment
  - Ethical requirements covered in 8 CCR ยง41

### Components of a Complete Report

- Reporting duties of primary treating physicians contain important definitions
  - Permanent and Stationary Status = point when the employee has reached maximal medical improvement, condition is well stabilized, and unlikely to change substantially in the next year with or without treatment
  - Future medical care = treatment which is anticipated at some time in the future and is reasonably required to cure or relieve the employee from the effects of the injury
- Important definitions in 8 CCR ยง9793
  - Medical-legal expenses = any costs or expenses incurred by or on behalf of any party or parties, the administrative director, or the appeals board for x-rays, laboratory fees, other diagnostic tests, medical reports, medical records, medical testimony, and as needed, interpreter's fees, for the purpose of proving or disproving a contested claim.
  - Comprehensive medical-legal evaluations = an evaluation which includes an examination of an employee, and which:
    1. Results in the preparation of a narrative medical report prepared and attested to in accordance with Section 4628 of the Labor Code, any applicable procedures promulgated under Section 139.2 of the Labor Code, and the requirements of Section 10682 and
    2. Is either
       - Performed by a QME pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 139.2 of the Labor Code or
       - Performed by a QME, Agreed Medical Evaluator, or the primary treating physician for the purpose of proving or disproving a contested claim, and which meets the requirements of paragraphs 1-5 of subdivision (h).
- **15 essential components to a complete report**
  1. Date of examination
  2. History of injury
  3. Patient's complaints
  4. Listing of all information received
  5. Patient's medical History
  6. Findings on examination
  7. A diagnosis
  8. Opinion as to the nature, extent, and duration of disability and work limitations, if any
  9. Cause of disability
  10. Treatment indicated (past, present, future)
  11. Opinion on permanent disability
  12. Apportionment of disability
  13. Percent of total causation if psychiatric injury
  14. Reasons for opinion
  15. Physician signature

### Substantial Medical Evidence

- Evidence must be reasonable, credible, and of solid value
- Convincing force and probability of truth
- Sufficient analysis of factual material
- NOT substantial medical evidence:
  - Erroneous, no longer germane reports
  - Based on speculation or conjecture
  - Irrelevant facts or assume incorrect legal theories
- Responsibilities of physician signing
  - Not inadmissable but considered in weighing the evidence
  - History, record review, conclusion of report
  - Date, location, and declaration under penalty of perjury

### Impairment Rating

- Included unless injured worked hasn't reached maximal medical improvement
- Calculated using AMA Guides
- Required for case resolution
- In unrepresented cases, Disability Evaluation Unit (DEU) issues summary rating determination
- Unrateable by DEU
  - Improper application of AMA Guides
  - Insufficient Evidence

### Apportionment

- Causation of permanent disability
- Worker's burden, employer's?
- Must include how and why apportionment level was declared
- If apportionment unable to be determined, state in report it is outside your scope and allow parties to find another capable physician
- Medical opinion must show familiarity of concepts of apportionment and describe exact nature of apportionable disability
- Medical opinion must be based on:
  - Pertinent facts
  - Adequate examination and history
  - Set forth the reasoning in support of its conclusion
- **Apportionment Pitfall**
  - Apportioning to causation of injury as opposed to causation of disability

### AMA Guides and Permanent Disability

- QME must provide whole person impairment (WPI) to ratings using AMA guides
- Opinion must be substantial evidence
- Almaraz/Guzman II
  - Objective factors using AMA Guides
  - Adequately capture the true disability
  - Rating by analogy
  - Difference between impairment and disability
    - Impairment = a loss, loss of use, or derangement of any body part, organ system, or organ function
    - Disability = an alteration of an individual's capacity to meet personal, social, or occupational demands or statutory or regulatory requirements because of an impairment

### Evaluating Impairment from Cancer or Other Serious Illnesses

- A comprehensive medical evaluation should take in full impact of the illness and its treatment

### The Concept of Apportionment and How to Apportion to Causation of Disability

Apportionment is a medical-legal term, meaning that it combines both the medical evaluation and the law. It is a way of figuring out how much of your permanent disability is due to your work injury and how much is due to other disabilities.

- Labor Code 4663
  - Apportionment based on causation
  - Report needs to address the causation of the disability
  - Report must include an apportionment determination
- Labor Code 4664
  - Employer only liable for the % of permanent disability directly caused by the work injury
  - If applicant received prior award of permanent disability, it is presumed the prior permanent disability exists
  - All permanent disability awards cannot exceed 100% unless the injury or illness is conclusively presumed to be total in character
- Apportionment...
  - May be based on pathology and asymptomatic prior conditions
  - May be based on "other factors" including:
    - the natural progression of a nonindustrial condition or disease
    - a preexisting disability
    - a post-injury disabling event

**Key Points on Apportionment**

- Employer only liable for permanent disability directly caused by industrial injury
- Employer not liable for disability that is the result of non-industrial causes or prior industrial injuries
- Apportionment is causation of disability, not causation of injury

### Substantial Medical Evidence and Relation to Apportionment

**Substantial Medical Evidence**

- An adequate and comprehensive examination
- Review of prior records, thorough history from worker, physical examination
- Impairment ratings applying AMA Guides
- Report findings must be supported by a rationale
- AMA Guides must be applied to determine permanent disability

**Apportionment Factors**

- Natural progression of any non-industrial condition/disease
- Pre-existing disabilities
- Prior industrial/non-industrial injuries
- Post-injury disabling events
- Pre-existing, non-industrial pathology
- Asymptomatic prior conditions

**Apportionment Substantial Medical Evidence Checklist**

- Was there an adequate medical exam of the injured worker?
- Was there an adequate exam of injured worker's medical history?
- Have all relevant factual circumstances been considered?
- Does the medical report address apportionment?
- Is the concept of apportionment applied correctly?
- Are the opinion and conclusions supported with explanations and reasoning?

**Risk Factors, Asymptomatic Conditions, and Apportionment**

- Apportionment to a "risk factor" is not appropriate
- "Risk Factor" alone cannot and does not cause permanent disability
- Apportionment must be based on _actual evidence_

**How to Avoid Common Causation Pitfalls**

- Physicians need thorough history and review all past medical records and assess what factors contribute to level of disability when making an apportionment determination
- Pre-existing conditions, even when asymptomatic, and subsequent conditions must be considered

### What is Bias and How to Avoid It

Bias is a strong inclination of the mind or a preconceived opinion about something or someone.

**Bias and Impairment Ratings**

- AMEs and QMEs must ensure their medical reporting is not influenced by bias
- Importing to be aware of unconscious bias
