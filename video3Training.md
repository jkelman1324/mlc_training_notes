# Basic Joint Anatomy

## The Nervous System

### Divisions of the Nervous System

- Central Nervous System (CNS)
  - Brain
  - Spinal Cord
- Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
  - Consists of nerves that run throughout the body
  - 2 subdivisions
    - Somatic
      - Carries sensory signals from the body to the central nervous system and nerves that carry motor signals from the CNS to the skeletal muscles
      - Voluntary movement
    - Autonomic
      - Involuntary, involved in regulating the internal environment of the body
      - Carries signals from internal organs to the CNS and vice versa
      - Regulates digestion and heartbeat
      - 2 further subdivisions
        - **Sympathetic** stimulates and mobilizes energy resources (fight or flight responses)
        - **Parasympathetic** acts to conserve energy (rest and digest responses)

### The Nervous System Part 1

- All thoughts and actions can be grouped into 3 categories
  1. Sensory input
  2. Integration
  3. Motor output
- Cells in nervous tissue
  - Neurons (nerve cells) respond to stimuli and transmit signals
    - 3 types
      1. Sensory (afferant) neurons transmit impulses from sensory receptors toward the CNS and are mostly unipolar
      2. Motor (efferent) neurons' impulses move from the CNS to the rest of the body and are mostly multipolar
      3. Interneurons (association) neurons are the most abundant type of neuron whose impulse moves between sensory and motor neurons and are mostly multipolar
    - Some of the longest-lived cells in your body
    - Irreplaceable
    - Amitotic (lose ability to divide)
    - Very high metabolic rate, 25% calories taken in consumed by brain activity
    - Structure includes cell body, dendrites and axon and come in three different forms
      1. Multipolar
      2. Bipolar
      3. Unipolar
  - Glial cells provide support, nutrition, insulation, and help with signal transmission in the nervous system
    - Satellite cells surround and support neuron cell bodies
    - Schwann cells produce an insulating barrier called the myelin sheath
    - Make up 50% of brain!
  - Astrocytes are involved in the exchange of materials between neurons and capillaries
  - Microglial cells are involved in immune defense against invading microorganisms
  - Ependymal cells create, secrete and circulate cerebrospinal fluid
  - Oligodendrocytes produce an insulating barrier called the myelin sheath

### The Nervous System Part 2

- Body as a whole is electrically neutral
- Action potential

voltage
: the measure of potential energy generated by separated charges; membrance potential

current
: the flow of electricity from one point to another; current = voltage/resistance

resistance
: whatever's getting in the way of the current

- Currents indicate the flow of positively or negatively charged ions across the resistance of your cells' membranes

- Resting neuron
  - more negative inside
  - resting membrane potential (~70mV)
- Sodium-potassium pump
- Electro-chemical gradient
- Ion channels
  - Voltage-gated channels open and close in response to changes in membrane potential
  - Ligand-gated channels open when a neurotransmitter latches onto its receptor
  - Mechanically-gated channels open in response to the physical stretching of the membrane
- Refractory period
  - Absolute refractory period
    - From depolarization to repolarization
    - Makes sure that each action potential is its own unique, all or nothing event
  - Relative refractory period
    - Spans from repolarization -> hyperpolarization -> resting potential
- Conduction velocity
- Saltatory conduction

### Spinal Nerves

- Part of PNS
- Consist of motor and sensory fibers
- 31 pairs of spinal nerves arising from spinal cord
  - 8 cervical
  - 12 thoracic
  - 5 lumbar
  - 5 sacral

#### Dermatomes and Cutaneous Fields

What sensory deficits occur when...

- you injure a BP root?
- you injure a peripheral nerve?

Dermatome
: an area of skin supplied by sensory neurons from a single spinal cord level (may be distributed by more than one peripheral nerve)

Cutaneous fields
: an area of skin supplied by sensory neurons from a single peripheral nerve

- Sensory neurons transport cutaneous sensation to different spinal cord levels

#### Brachial plexus
