# AMA Impairment Rating

## Work Comp Defense Prep

AMA Guides used to "determine impairment, the Legislature furthered its expressly stated goal of achieving 'consistency, uniformity, and objectivity'" - _Almaraz Guzman 09/03/2009_

### Almaraz Guzman

- rating not automatic
- must be substantial evidence
- within four corners of AMA Guides
- physician rationale required

### Chapter 15: The Spine

- spine structure
  - cervical (8)
  - thoracic (12)
  - lumbar (5)
  - sacrum
  - coccyx
  - motion segment = 2 adjacent vertebrae, intervertebral disc, facet joints, and ligemtous structure
- radiculopathy
  - defined as significant alteration in the function of a nerve root or nerve roots and is usually caused by pressure on one or several nerve roots
  - "diagnosis requires a dermatomal distribution of pain, numbness, and/or pareshesias in a dermatomal distribution. A root tension sign is usually positive. The diagnosis of herniated disk must be substantiated by an appropriate finding on an imaging study. The presence of findings on an imaging study in and of itself does not make the diagnosis of radiculopathy. There must also be clinical evidence" (p. 382)
  - "It is important to note that a positive imaging study in and of itself does not make the diagnosis...An imaging study alone is insufficient to qualify for a DRE category. Individuals with electromyography (EMG) studies that are clearly positive support a diagnosis of radiculopathy and therefore qualify for at least DRE caregory III." (p. 378)
  - herniated disc
  - compression fracture
- DRE method of evaluation
  - the principle methodoly used to evaluate an individual who has had a distinct injury
  - criteria
    - single level involvement
    - corticospine injury
- ROM method of evaluation
  - criteria
    - multi-level or bilateral radiculopathy
    - multi-level surgery
    - multi-level AOMSI
    - multi-level fracture
    - recurrent radiculopathy
- impairment evaluations are performed after the injured worker attains MMI
- DRE Categories
  1. subjective findings only
  2. muscle guarding, spasm/asymmetric ROM, unverified radiculopathy, resolved verified radiculopathy
  3. unresolved verified radiculopathy, spine surgery level one
  4. alteration motion segment integrity (fusion), bilateral or multi-level radiculopathy (cervical, thoracic spines)
  5. alteration motion segment integrity with radiculopathy
- symptoms, signs, & tests
  - muscle guarding
  - muscle spasm
  - asymmetry of spinal motion
  - non-verifiable radicular root pain
  - fractures
    - compression of one vertebral body
    - posterior element fracture without dislocation
    - a spinous or transverse process fracture
  - radiculopathy
    - no history of radiculopathy
    - resolved radiculopathy w/o surgery
    - resolved radiculopathy w/ surgery
    - radiculopathy at MMI
  - surgeries
  - aleration of motion segment integrity
    - fusion
    - instability - increased translational or angular motion

### ROM Method

- when to use?
  - impairment caused by illness, not specific (or CT) injury, or cause is uncertain
  - statutorily mandated
  - multilevel involvement in the same region
  - multilevel alteration of motion segment integrity (AOMSI) - fusions
- criteria
  - multi-level or bilateral radiculopathy
  - multi-level surgery
  - multi-level AOMSI
  - multi-level fracture
  - recurrent radiculopathy
- consists of 3 elements
  1. range of motion of the impaired spine region
  - two - inclinometer technique
  - physician should seek consistency
    - inconsistent results are repeated
    - disregard if results remain inconsistent
  - should match known pathology
  - at least three measurements for each motion
  - greatest measurement used for impairment
  - lumbar flexion requires sacral (hip) flexion angle -- accessory validity test -- p. 406
  - all impairments within same region are added
  2. accompanying diagnosis
  - all impairment found in table 15-7, p. 404
    - four sections (disorders), if more than one applies, use the one providing greatest impairment
    - table only used when the ROM method is used
  - always read footnotes
  - when multiple levels involved, impairment added for additional levels only
  3. spinal nerve deficit
  - motor
  - sensory
  - not always applicable; if not addressed, look for sensory or motor complaints
  - use tables on p. 424
    - tables 15-17 and 15-18 provide extremity impairment, not WPI
  - not frequently used by doctors
  - process used is similar to:
    - peripheral nerve disorders in extremities
    - strength loss in shoulder and elbow
  - nerve impairments are adjusted separately
- spinal nerve procedure
  - identify nerve(s) involved
  - determine grade/deficit (tables 15-15 and 15-16)
  - obtain maximum value (tables 15-17 and 15-18)
  - for sensory and motor deficits
    - multiply maximum value by % deficit
    - repeat for each nerve involved
    - combine all sensory impairments at extremity level
    - convert to WPI
  - adjust sensory and motor deficit separately
- combining rules for ROM method
  - may have as many as 4 WPI values
    - loss of motion
    - accompanying diagnosis
    - spinal nerve deficit - sensory
    - spinal nerve deficit - motor
  - combine loss of motion and accompanying diagnosis at WPI level, adjust
  - adjust sensory impairment
  - adjust motor impairment
  - combine

### DRE or ROM

- DRE
  - single level
  - corticospinal tract
- ROM
  - multilevel: surgery, fracture, AOMSI
  - radiculopathy that is:
    - multilevel
    - bilateral
    - recurrent

## Chapter 16: Upper Extremities

### Conversion Digit Values to Hand Value

- thumb 40%
- index 20%
- middle 20%
- ring 10%
- little 10%
- hand 100%
- conversion table 16-1 digit to hand (p. 438)

### Conversion

- 100% upper extremity (UE) = 60% WPI
- 100% hand = 90% UE = 54% WPI
- 100% thumb = 40% hand = 36% UE = 22% WPI
- 100% index/middle = 20% hand = 18% UE = 11% WPI
- 100% ring/little = 10% hand = 9% UE = 5% WPI

### 7 Methods in AMA Guide

#### Amputations (p. 441-445)

- assess level of amputation
- thumb amputation at MP joint = 100% thumb, 40% hand, 36% UE, 22% WPI
- little finger at PIP joint = 80% digit, 8% hand, 7% UE, 4% WPI
- humerus at proximal to deltoid tubercle level (axillary fold) = 100% UE, 60% WPI
- amputation at scapulothoracic level (forequarter) = 70% WPI
- "The most practical and useful approach to evaluating impairment of a digit is to compare the current loss of function with the loss resulting from amputation." (p. 434 AMA Guides)
- "The composite rating for an extremity (after adjustments) may not exceed the amputation value of the extremity adjusted for earning capacity, occupation and age." (p. 1-11 2005 PDRS)

#### Digital Nerve Lesions (section 16.3)

- not to be used for peripheral nerve disorders or CRPS
- sensibility defects on the dorsal surfaces of the digits are not considered impairing
- "The sensory quality is based on the results of the two-point discrimination test carried out over the distal palmar area of the digit, or on the most distal part of the stump in the presence of a partial amputation." (p. 446)
- doctor must provide three pieces of information ti properly determine impairment due to digital nerve lesion
  1. sensory loss (two-point discrimination)
  2. percentage of digit length affected
  3. digital nerve involvement (longitudinal - ulnar or radial or transverse - both). The information is then used with table 16-6 (p. 448 thumb and little finger) or table 16-7 (p. 448 index, middle, and ring fingers) to determine impairment.

#### ROM/Ankylosis

neutral position
: 0 degrees = "full extension" (not 180 degrees)

flexion
: F

extension
: E "motion opposite to flexion"

extension lag
: incomplete extension from a flexed position to the neutral starting point

hyperextension
: extension exceeding the zero starting position

ankylosis
: complete loss of motion of a joint = F + E

plus sign
: + joint hyperextension

minus sign
: - extension lag

arc of motion
: degrees traced between the two extreme positions of movement in a specific plane (F to E)

unit of motion
: joint has more than one plane of movement, each is referred to as a unit of motion

functional position
: the least impairing angle for fusion

- measurement hints
  - "both extremities should be compared" (p. 451)
    - if uninvolved "normal" contralateral joint has less than normal ROM, subtract its ROM from impaired joint
    - if uninvolved has greater than normal ROM, may correct up to 2% of max. regional impairment rating
- motion impairment calculation
  - motion impairment pie charts are used for motion calculatioin of a **specific joint**
  - the impairment values derived for each are **added together** to obtain the total motion impairment of a **specific joint**
  - thumb ray has three articular units: IP, MP, and CMC. add the impairment values contributed by each motion unit (p. 460)
  - fingers have three functional units: DIP, PIP, and MP each calculate as a specific joint. combine the finger impairments from each joint
  - IF two or more digits are involved, calculate separately the total digit impairment for each
  - use table 16-1 convert each digit to hand impairment
  - add hand impairment values from each digit to obtain total hand impairment
  - if thumb amputation is proximal to MP joint (CMC joint) the other digits are converted to UE, then added to the UE value for the thumb ray
- thumb injury and total transverse loss of IP joint
  - IP joint = 50% digit length
  - figure 16-6 (p. 447) = 25% digit
  - table 16-6 (p. 448) = 25% digit
- total transverse sensory loss @ MP joint middle finger
  - 50% digit (fig. 16-7 p. 447)
  - 10% hand (p. 438)
  - 9% UE (p. 439)
  - 5% WPI (p. 439)

#### Peripheral Nerve Disorders (p. 480-497)

- evaluates
  - impairments related to disorders of the spinal nerves (C5 to C8 and T1)
  - brachial plexus
  - major peripheral nerves of the UE
  - entrapment/compression neuropathy
  - complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)
- underlying causes
  - diabetes mellitus
  - chronic alcohol abuse
  - systemic neurological disorders
  - hypothyroidism and other systemic disease
  - if any of the above, apportionment
- evaluation principles (p. 480)
  - sensory deficits in the digits strictly due to lesions of digital nerves are evaluated by section 16.3
  - impairments relating to the spinal cord and central nervous system are considered in chapters 13 and 15 of the guides
  - impairment due to chronic pain discussed in chapter 18
  - when an impairment results strictly from a peripheral nerve lesion, in the absence of CRPS, the motion values derived from seciton 16.4 are not applied to this section to avoid duplication or unwarranted increase in the impairment estimation
- evaluation methods
  1. ID nerve involved (doctor's job)
  2. grade sensory loss w/ table 16-10 (doctor's job)
  3. grade motor loss (doctor's job)
  4. ID max sensory value (you can do)
  5. ID max motor value (you can do)
  6. multiply sensory grade by max sensory value
  7. multiply motor grade by max motor value
  8. combine sensory w/ motor
  9. convert: UE to WPI
- RED FLAGS
  - decreased pinch strength
  - decreased grip strength
  - sensory deficits due to digital nerve lesions
  - "In compression neuropathies, additional impairment values are not given for decreased grip strength. In the absence of CRPS, additional impairment values are not given for decreased motion." (p. 494)
- entrapment at median nerve at wrist -> carpal tunnel and ulnar nerve at elbow -> cubital tunnel are most typical
- carpal tunnel syndome post-operative (p. 495)
  1. positive clinical findings of median nerve dysfunction and electrical conduction delay(s)
  2. normal sensibility/strength w/ abnormal sensory and/or motor latencies or abnormal EMG testing = rating not to exceed 5% UE (3% WPI)
  3. normal sensibility, opposition strength, nerve conduction studies = 0% UE
- complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS p. 495-498)
  - reflex sympathetic dystrophy (CRPS I)
  - causalgia (CRPS II)
  - burning pain w/o stimulation or movement
  - "The diagnosis of the syndromes should be conservative and based on objective findings." (p. 496)
  - at least eight of the findings must be present concurrently for a diagnosis (p. 496)

#### Peripheral Vascular Disease

- usually involves diseases of arteries, veins and lymphatic disorders
- vascular disorders cause...
  - reduced blood flow
  - intermittent claudication
  - pain at rest
  - ulcers
  - gangrene
  - extremity loss
  - raynaud's phenomenon
- physical signs of vascular damage must be present and are the primary determinants in placing the examinee into one of these categories

#### Strength (p. 507-510)

- grip & pinch strength
- manual muscle testing
- "Because strength measurements are functional tests influenced by sunjective factors that are difficult to control and the Guides for the most part is based on anatomic impairment, the Gudies does not assign a large role to such measurements." (p. 507)
- strength impairment is only provided in the "rare case" (p. 508)
- strength loss can be combined w/ other impairments "only if based on unrelated etiologic or pathomechanical causes." (p. 508)
- decreased strength cannot be rated in the presence of decreased motion, painful conditions, deformities, or absence of parts (e.g. thumb amputation) that prevent effective application of maximal force in the region being evaluated.
- "motor weakness associated with disorders of the peripheral nerve system and various degenerative neuromuscular conditions are evaluated according to guidelines described in section 16.5..." (p. 508)
- "strength can only be applied as a measure when a year or more has passed since the time of injury or surgery." (p. 508)
- "manual muscle testing of major groups is used for testing strength about the elbow and shoulder." (p. 508)
- "if there is more than 20% variation in the readings, one may assume the individual is not exerting full effort." (p. 508)
- "results of strength testing should be repoducible on different occasions or by two or more trained observers." (p. 509)
- tendinitis
  - "several syndromes involving UE are variously attributed to tendinitis, fasciitis, or epicondylitis. the most common of these are the stubborn conditions of the origins of the flexor and extensor muscle of the forearm where they attach to the medial and lateral epicondyles of the humerus. although these conditions may be persistent for some time, they are not given a permanent impairment rating unless there is some other factor that must be considered." (p. 507)
  - grip loss can be considered "if an individual has had tendon rupture or has under-gone surgical release of the flexor or extensor origins or medial or lateral epicondylitis, or has had excision of the epicondyle, there may be some permanent weakness of grip as a result fo the tendon rupture of the surgery. in this case, impairment can be given on the basis of weakness of grip strength according to section 16.8b." (p. 507)

#### "Other" Disorders (497-507)

- only used when other criteria have not adequately encompassed the impairment
- the severity of impairment due to these disorders is rated separately according to tables 16-19 through 16-30 and then multiplied by the relative maximum value fo the unit involved as specified in table 16-18 (p. 498)
- synovial hypertrophy cannot be combined with other methods: "if synovial hypertrophy is the only finding, the joint impairment is rated according to table 16-19 and multiplied by the relative maximum value of the joint involved (table 16-18). it cannot be combined with impairment due to decreased joint motion or other findings." (p. 500)
- shoulder instability
  - must be thoroughly documented: "shoulder instability, recurrent subluxation, or dislocation must be adequately documented through a complete medical history, physical examination, and radiographic findings. MRI, arthroscopy, and examination under anesthesia may be useful components of the evaluation. An individual's complaint of feeling or fearing that a joint is 'popping' or 'going out of place' without adequate clinical findings is not a basis for permanent impairment rating." (p. 504)
  - shoulder representing 60% of UE (table 16-18), the patterns of occult(10%), subluxating (20%), and disclocating (40%) instabilities represent UE impairments of 6%, 12%, and 24% respectively (p. 504)
  - shoulder instability impairment can only be combined with decreased motion impairment: "this value may be combined only with impairments due to decreased motion (section 16.4). pain and decreased muscle strength are not rated separately." (p. 504)

## Chapter 17: Lower Extremity (LE)

- 100% LE = 40% WPI (table 17-3 p. 527)
- 100% foot = 70% LE
- numbers that are put together for evaluation for impairment/pd must be either added or combined
  - **COMBINE** unless specific instructions state to **ADD** impairment values. the effect/purpose of combining is that it prevents the combined value from exceeding 100 (A + B(1-A) where A and B are decimal equivalents)
  - **ADD** when involving the evaluation of range of motion impairment for the same part of the body
- how to combine (p. 1-11 2005 PDRS):
  - multiple impairments such as those involving a single part of an extremity, e.g. two impairment involving a shoulder such as shoulder instability and limited range of motion, are ocmbined at the UE level, then converted to WPI and adjusted before being combined with other parts of the same extremity
  - impairments w/ disability numbers in the 16.01 and 17.01 series are converted to whole person impairment and adjusted before being combined with any other impairment of the same extremity
  - impairment of an individual extremity are adjusted and combined at the whole person (PD) level with other impairments of the same extremity before being combined w/ impairments of other body parts. e.g. an impairment of the left knee and ankle would be combined before further combination w/ an impairment of the opposing leg or the back

### Methods Used to Evaluate Impairments of LE

#### Limb Length Discrepency

- x-rays strongly recommended
- repeat 3 times, "averaged to reduce measurement error" (p. 528)

#### Gait Derangement

- "expect as otherwise noted...table 17-5 \[is\] for full-time gait derangement of persons who are dependent on assistive devices."
- not for "abnormalities based only on subjective factors, such as pain or sudden giving-way, as with...an individual with low-back discomfort who chooses to use a cane to assist in walking."
- **should only be used when no other method is available to rate the person**

#### Muscle Atrophy (Unilateral)

- at thigh 10cm above patella
- calf at "max level"
- must compare measurement to opposite, uninjured LE
- combine thigh and calf atrophy
- atrophy measurements
  - compare measurement to opposite member
  - different in circumference might be:
    - swelling
    - varicose veins
    - opposite member injured
- example
  - right tibia fracture
  - MMI
  - pain-free walking
  - right thigh atrophy = 2cm -> 8% LE = 3% WPI
  - right calf atrophy = 1cm -> 3% LE = 1% WPI
  - combine: 8% C 3% = 11 LE
  - convert 11% LE = 4% WPI

#### Manual Muscle Testing

- tables 17-7 and 17-8 (p. 531-532)
- note type - hip abduction, grade 3 = 37% LE
- cautions (p. 531)
  - "depends on the examinee's cooperation"
  - "should be concordant with other...signs and medical evidence"
  - more than one grade between examiners
  - more than one grade from exam to exam
  - pain
  - fear of pain
  - attributed to deficit of a peripheral nerve

#### Range of Motion

- p. 533-538
- use only "if it is clear...restricted \[ROM\] has an organic basis..."
- obtain 3 measurements; use greatest
- **add** ROM impairments in joint
- example
  - ankle flexion of 6° = 6% WPI (15% LE) (table 17-11, p. 537)
  - ankle extension of 5° = 3% WPI (7% LE) (table 17-11)
  - 1cm calf atrophy = 1% WPI (table 17-6, p. 530)
  - add flexion and extension -> 15% LE + 7% LE = 22% LE = 9% WPI
  - do not use atrophy (1% WPI)
- invalid if:
  - class inconsistency between 2 observers
  - class inconsistency between exams
  - pain
  - fear of pain

#### Ankylosis

- hip = 50% LE = 20% WPI (p. 538)
- knee = 67% LE = 27% WPI (p. 540)
- ankle = 14% foot = 10% LE = 4% WPI (p. 541)
- toes (see table 17-30 p. 543)

1. determine value for "optimal position"
2. use tables (p. 538-543) for deviation values (malposition increases impairment)
3. **add** multiple malpositions for same join
4. **combine** ankylosis of different joints
5. "the baseline rating for ankylosis in a neutral position is used only once for each joint."

#### Arthritis

- use x-rays "standing if possible" with table 17-31 (p. 544)
- () = normal cartilage intervals
- compare **uninjured** opposite member
- 17-31 footnote states if:
  1. direct trauma,
  2. patellofemoral pain (between knee cap and thigh bone/femur), and
  3. "crepitation" on physical exam;
  4. no joint space narrowing => 2% WPI (5% LE)
- the knee has a medial and lateral compartment
  - only the more significant loss is used (can be combined w/ patellofemoral arthritis)

#### Amputations

- see table 17-32 (p. 545)

#### Diagnoses-Based Estimates

- see table 17-33 (used in 70-80% of LE cases)
- covers 9 regions/conditions
  1. pelvis
  2. hip
  3. femoral shaft fracture
  4. knee
  5. malalignment of tibial shaft fracture
  6. ankle
  7. hindfoot
  8. midfoot deformity
  9. forefoot deformity

#### Skin Loss (p. 550)

- see table 17-36
- full-thickness skin loss: impairment "even when the areas are successfully covered with \[a\]...skin graft."
- chronic osteomyelitis (bone infection, usually bacterial infection of bone marrow; resulting inflammation can lead to reduction of blood supply to bone) **too**

#### Peripheral Nerve Injuries (p. 550-552)

- table 17-37 - maximum impairment values
- assessed sensory/motor deficits are applied
- combine with other LE methods **except**:
  - muscle weakness
  - atrophy
  - gait (p. 552)
- dysethesia (p. 600)
  - impairment of sensitivity, especially to touch. altered feelings, such as burning, wetness, electric shock, pins and needles, itching

#### Causalgia & CRPS (p. 553)

- CRPS I = RSD
- CRPS II = causalgia
- "characterized by pain, swelling, stiffness, discoloraiton...skeletal demineralization"
- may follow a sprain, fracture or nerve or vascular injury
- "to rate \[causalgia and RSD\]..., diagnosis is key..."
  - diagnosis: rely on clinical findings, three-phase bone scan, x-rays, laser Doppler flowmetry, sudomotor reflex
  - table 16-16 (p. 496)

#### Vascular Disorders (p. 553-554)

**intermittent claudication**
: cramping or aching in the calves (sometimes the thighs or buttocks) caused by walking; relieved by rest; a manifestation of atherosclerosis (blockage of an artery). it is called "intermittent" because of the pattern of pain only with walking.

**edema**
: abnormal buildup of fluid in the ankles, feet and legs.

- common causes
  - prolonged standing
  - long airplane flights or automobile rides
  - menstrual periods (for some women)
  - pregnancy
  - being overweight
  - increased age
  - injury or trauma

## AMA Guides "Red Flags" & Tricks of the Trade

### I. Combining

- combine values chart (p. 604)
- method used to combine multiple impairments, derived from the formula A + B(1-A) = _combined_ values of A and B
- ensures that the summary value will not exceed 100% whole person
- say goodbye to MDT (multiple disability table)
- all impairments are:
  - converted to WPI
  - adjusted for FEC, age and occupation
  - combined

#### Combine or Add, and CVC

- numbers that are put together for evaluation of impairment/pd must be either added or combined
- **COMBINE**
  - for most situations - unless specific instructions state to ADD impairment values
  - atrophy (17-4, p. 531)
  - strength (17-5, p. 532)
  - arthritis (knee - patellofemoral w/ knee, lateral or medial compartment, if applicable)
  - peripheral nerve (p. 550)
  - combine largest to smallest (ignore instructions elsewhere)
- **ADD**
  - the most notable exception to combining = ROM for the same part of the body
  - ROM for the same part of the body (p. 533)

#### Combined Values Chart

- use chart in PDRS (section 8)
- the combined values chart in the AMA Guides has 5 errors (p. 604-606)
  - 54 c 12 = 60 (not 59)
  - 58 c 25 = 69 (not 68)
  - 94 c 78 = 99 (not 98)
  - 95 c 30 = 97 (not 96)
  - 95 c 34 = 97 (not 96)

#### UE and LE Impairments (per PDRS)

- extremity impairments are:
  - adjusted for FEC, age, occupation
  - combined with other impairments of _same_ extremity before combining extremity impairments with other body parts

#### Pain Add-On

- max is 3% WPI
- 3% can be subdivided between different impairments
- add impairments to WPI value for affected body part(s) before adjustments

### II. Measuring Decreased Ability to "Work" vs. "Impairment"

**impairment**
: loss, loss of use, or derangement of any body part, organ system or organ function. measured against impact on activities of daily living (ADL); measured by AMA Guides

**disability**
: effect of impairment on ability to meet occupational demands. measured against earning capacity loss; measured by California PD Schedule

#### Whole Person Impairment

- does not measure "disability" or "P.D."
- 90% WPI may = 100% PD
- "the Guides is not intended to be used for direct estimates of work disability."
- impairment percentages derived according to the Guides criteria do not measure work disability
- "\[I\]t is inappropriate to use the Guides' criteria or ratings to make direct estimates of work disability." (p. 9)

#### Adjustments for Lack of Treatment

- "If a patients declines \[surgical, pharmacologic or therapeutic treatment of an impairment\], that decision neither decreased nor increases the estimated percentage of...impairment." (p. 20)
- ^ **WRONG! (see _Hanker_ below)**

### III. Pain

- "If the individual appears to have pain-related impairment that has increased the burden of his or her condition slightly, the examiner may increase the percentage...by up to 3%." (p. 573)
- NOT automatic
- 3% per injury
- chapter 18 analysis required
- "impairment ratings in the Guides already have accounted for pain" (p. 570)
- "\[I\]f an examining physician determines...an individual has pain-related impairment, \[must decide whether\]...that impairment has already been adequately incorporated into the rating..." (p. 570)
- pain chapter **NOT** used for:
  1. conditions adequately rated using other chapter(s)
  2. low credibility/unwilling or unable to provide information
  3. "ambiguous or controversial pain syndromes"
  4. myofascial pain
  5. fibromyalgia
  6. "disputed neurogenic"
  7. thoracic outlet syndrome
- "the judgment that pain-related impairment is unratable does not mean that the evaluating physician considers the pain to be 'unreal' or fabricated." (p. 572)
- rate pain if:
  1. "body system impairment rating" is inadequate, and
  2. pain increased "burden of condition" slightly
  3. if the above are true, "may increase...by up to 3%"
- if pain increases burden "substantially":
  1. perform formal pain assessment
  2. tables 18-4 and 18-6
  3. detemrine class
  4. ratable?
  5. if ratable, "award" up to 3%
- the schedule (p. 1-12) is **WRONG!**
  - not "addition"
  - the pain-related impairment is combined with the conventional impairment
  - see errata (p. 584 \[5(b)-(c)\] and p. 589 \["impairment rating" (2)\])

### IV. AMA "Treatment" Rules Conflict With Labor Code/Case Law

- LC 4056:

  > No compensation is payable in case of the death or disability of an employee when his death is caused, or when and so far as his disability is caused, continued, or aggrevated by an unreasonable refusal to submit to medical treatment, or to any surgical treatment, if the risk of the treatment is, in the opinion of the appeals board, based upon expert medical or surgical advice, inconsiderable in view of the seriousness of the injury.

- adjustments for lack of treatment

  > If a patient declines \[surgical, pharmacologic or therapeutic treatment of an impairment\], that decision neither decreased nor increases the estimated percentage of...impairment. (p. 20)

- _Hanker v. City of Stockton PD_
  - CT to heart; extreme fatigue: difficult to function
  - 2 treatment options
    1. medication (80% WPI)
    2. ablation procedure (0%)

### V. ROM (rather than DRE)

- not valued
  - spondylolysis
  - spondylolisthesis
  - herniated disc w.o radiculopathy (why?)
  - aging changes (why?)
- two methods of spinal evaluation
  - DRE - "primary method"
  - ROM - only if exception to DRE exists
- not sufficient
  - "ROM provides greater PD"
  - "ROM is fairer"
  - "ROM more accurately reflects PD" (violate Guzman?)
  - silence (not golden)
- ROM if:
  - cause not clear
  - statutorily mandated (not in california)
  - "multilevel involvement in the same spinal region"
    - not multilevel DDD
    - not multilevel 'bulges'
    - not multilevel herniations w/o radiculopathy
    - multilevel fractures
    - multilevel herniations _with_ radiculopathy
    - multilevel stenosis _with_ radiculopathy
    - DEU position - multi-level
      - multi-level bulges, degernative changes or herniations != ROM
      - need multi-level (or bilateral) radiculopathy
  - "alteration of motion segment integrity at multiple levels"
    - fusions
  - "recurrent radiculopathy"
    - requirements:
      - imaging study confirmation (MRI)
      - "significant" impact on nerve root function
      - "dermatomal distribution"/clinical confirmation
  - multiple episodes of "alteration of motion segment integrity"
    - increased translational motion
    - increased angular motion
    - decreased motion from:
      - developmental fusion
      - healed fracture
      - healed infection
      - arthrodesis

### VI. Grip/Pinch Mistakes

- UE strength evaluation (p. 507-510)
  - grip & pinch strength
  - manual muscle testing
- **RED FLAGS**

  > Because strength measurements are...influenced by subective factors...the Guides does not assign a large role to such measurements.
  > Many subjective...factors, including fatigure, handedness, time of day, age, nutritional state, pain...cooperation...influence strength measurements.
  > \[T\]he correlation of strength with performance of activities of daily living is poor...increased strength does not necessarily equate with increased function

- when grip/pinch can be used
  - in a "rare case" (p. 508, AMA Guides 5th)
  - not in presence of "painful conditions"
  - not in presence of "decreased motions"
  - not in presence of "deformities"
  - not if there is an "absence of parts"
  - not for elbow, shoulder injuries
  - not within 1 year of injury/surgery
  - not if >20% variation
  - not if "evidence \[of\] less than maximal effort" (p. 509, AMA Guides 5th)
  - not to rate carpal tunnel (p. 595)

### VII. Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS p. 495-498)

- reflex sympathetic dystrophy (CRPS I)
- casualgia (CRPS II)
- burning pain w/o stimulation or movement
- plan on LIFE PENSION
- consider psyche injury

> \[T\]he diagnosis of the syndromes should be conservative and based on objective findings. p. 496
> At least eight of \[the\] findings \[in table 16-16, p. 496\] must be present concurrently for a diagnosis of CRPS.

### VIII. Carpal Tunnel

**entrapment neuropathy**
: a nerve compression-type lesion that implies disproportion between the volume of the peripheral nerve and the space through which it passes.

- causes
  - pressure on the median nerve
  - caused by anything reducing space in carpal tunnel
  - repetitive, forceful grasping with hands
  - repitive bending of the wrist
  - vibrating tools
  - hormonal changes
- conditions that may play a role
  - arthritis
  - diabetes
  - thyroid imbalance
  - broken or dislocated bones in the wrist that cause swelling
  - tunnel size
  - heredity
    - genes account for about half of cases!
    - much higher risk in women who have an identical twin w/ disorder compared to those w/o
  - metabolic diseases
  - autoimmune diseases
  - pregnancy
  - body weight

## PD Rating Issues

### 4660.1

- **This section shall apply to injuries occurring on or after January 1, 2013**
- (b)...(AMA) Guides... whole person impairment, as provided in the Guides, multiplied by an **adjustment factor of 1.4**
- (c) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), **there shall be no instances in impairment ratings for sleep dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, or psychiatric disorder, or any combination thereof, arising out of a compensable physical injury.** Nothing in this section shall limit the ability of an injured employee to obtain treatment for sleep dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, or psychiatric disorder, if any, that are consequence of an industrial injury
  - (paragraph 2 addresses psychiatric injury associated with violent act, or catastrophic injury)

### Pain

- section 18.5, on pages 583-584, includes an Errata, and explains "How to Rate Pain-Related Impairment"

> if pain related impairment increases the individual's burden of illness _slightly_ beyond that indicated by his or her conventional impairment rating, award the conventional impairment and combine this with discretionary quantitative pain-related impairment of 1%, 2%, or 3%

- the DEU expressed in the 15th Annual DWC Educational Conference, that a pain add-on "assumes an underlying body system impairment rating greater than zero" (_CUrrent Rating Issues_, page 18). this has also been affirmed in the Blackledge en banc decision of 6/3/10 (page 22)
- **There may be exceptions:**
  - City of Sacramento v WCAB and Arthur Cannon, 3rd Appellate District Court of Appeal (12/26/13) -- allowed the use of rating by analogy for pain related functional deficit, without ratable objective findings "no objective abnormalities were identifiable, but he continued to experience pain in his left heel that affected weight-bearing activities"
- **Page 1-12 of the 2005 PDRS:**
  > The addition of up to 3% for pain is to be made at the whole person level. For example, if an elbow were to be increased by 3% for pain, the rating for the elbow would first be converted to the whole person scale, and then increased. The resultant rating would then be adjusted for diminished future earning capacity, occupation and age.
  > In the case of multiple impairments, the evaluating physician shall, when medically justifiable, attribute the pain in whole number increments to the appropriate impairments. The additional percentage added for pain will be applied to the respective impairments as described in the preceding paragraph.
- Example: 41 year old truck driver with loss of elbow range of motion calculated at 10% UE, plus 2% WPI for pain. 10% UE is converted, to 6% WPI. 2% WPI for pain is added, and the 8% WPI is the standard rating.
- 16.03.01.00 -- 8 -- \[1.4\]11 -- 350H -- 14 -- 14% PD

### Headaches

- the DEU adopted the position that, following direct trauma to the head, up to 3% WPI can be assigned due to residual headaches
- impairment # 13.01.00.99 as a 'consciousness disorder', has been assigned
- table 13-2, p. 309 of the Guides, is used to evaluate Impairment of **Consciousness and Awareness**, and is rated using impairment # 13.01.00.00
- only the "most severe cerebral impairment", from tables 13-2 to 13-8 can be used (p. 308)

### Combine or Add, and CVC

- chapter 15 -- spine
  - **ADD**
    - table 15-7 - page 404: ROM method -- spinal disorder -- "ADD"
    - range of motion impairments -- "ADD" (p. 408)
  - **COMBINE** -- ROM method:
    - spinal disorder w/ range of motion (p. 403)
    - UE or LE impairment from more than one nerve root (table 15-17, 15-18)
- chapter 16 -- the upper extremities
  - ROM for the same part of the body (for example, four motions for the wrist; range of motion impairment for the wrist and shoulder are added only for each joint)
  - _Exception:_ the evaluation of hands/multiple digits, is quite complex. the instructions within chapter 16 are summarized on page 511. for the thumb, add all ROM impairment for the same joint; combine impairment for separate joints
  - **Combine** impairments from separate methods of evaluation for the same body part, including digits (for example, ROM and digital sensory loss)
  - the upper extremity impairment evaluation record, on p. 436-437, also includes instruction
  - figure 16-1b, section II, instructs to combine Regional Impairment of the upper extremity. **For California WC, we do not use "regional impairment"**. Each body part is adjusted separately (eg, hand, wrist, elbow, shoulder)
  - peripheral nerve -- COMBINE sensory/motor deficit impairments (each injured nerve is adjusted separately as allowed by impairment numbers on page 2-4 of the 2005 PDRS)
- chapter 17
  - **ADD**
    - ROM for the same part of the body - (p. 533)
  - **COMBINE**
    - atrophy (ex. 17-4, p. 531)
    - strength (example 17-5, p. 532)
    - arthrities - (knee -- patellofemoral w/ knee, lateral or medial compartment, if applicable)
    - peripheral nerve -- (p. 550)
  - **How to combine:**
    - multiple impairments such as those involving a single part of an extremity, e.g. two impairment involving a shoulder such as shoulder instability and limited range of motion, are combined at the upper extremity level, then converted to whole person impairment and adjusted before being combined with other parts of the same extremity
    - impairments with disability numbers in the 16.01 and 17.01 series are converted to whole person impairment and adjusted before being combined with any other impairment of the same extremity
    - impairments of an individual extremity are adjusted and combined at the whole person \[PD\] level with other impairments of the same extremity before being combined with impairments of other body parts. for example, an impairment of the left knee and ankle would be combined before further combination with an impairment of the opposing leg or the back
  - **CVC -- Combined Values Chart:**
    - section 8 of the 2005 PDRS. based on the formula: a + b(1-a) where "a" and "b" are the decimal equivalents of the impairment or disability percentages. "a" is the higher number of the 2 being combined
    - combine largest to smallest
    - with PD (following adjustment for FEC or 1.4, occupation, and age) combine PD for a single extremity first; then combine largest to smallest
    - for impairment for the same part of an extremity, combine at extremity impairment value, and then convert to WPI

### Hearing Loss Chapter 11

- section 11.1 p. 246
  - assistive devices must not be used during the determination of a hearing impairment rating
- section 11.2a
  - criteria for rating impairment due to hearing loss, p. 246-251
- audiometric measures
  - without assistive devices
  - decibel (loudness)
    - scale of 0 dB -100 dB is used - below 0 and above 100 are taken as minimum 0 and maximum 100
  - frequency (pitch -- in Hz)
    - ratable frequencies:
      - 500, 100, 2000, 3000 (most speech falls within these frequencies)
      - add dB level from each of these four frequencies = DSHL (decibel sum hearing loss)
- table 11-2 (p. 248-249) -- BHI - Binaural Hearing Impairment -- match DSHL from both ears to obtain BHI (11-1 = monaural hearing loss)
- tinnitus - p. 246 - "in the presence of...hearing impairment may impair speech discrimination". If so, "add up to 5%" if it impacts ADLs. (example 11-2 clarifies that the value for that "up to 5%" in in BHI)
- table 11-3 - Conversion of BHI total to WPI

### Rating Psyche Injury

- AMA Guides - ch. 14 p. 361
  > Percentages are not provided to estimate mental impairment in this edition of the Guides. Unlike cases with some organ systems, there are no precise measures of impairment in mental disorders. The use of percentages implies a certainty that does not exist. Percentages are likely to be used inflexibly by adjudicators, who then are less likely to take into account the many factors that influence mental and behavioral impairment. In addition, the authors are unaware of data that show the reliability of the impairment percentages. After considering this difficult matter, the Committee on Disability and Rehabilitation of the American Psychiatric Association advised Guides contributors against the use of percentages in the chapter on mental and behavioral disorders of the fourth edition, and that remains the opinion of the authors of the present chapter.
- American Psychiatric Association
- _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition-Revised (DSM-III -R) 1987_
- DSM-IV-TR, released in 2000 included some changes to the table
- the DSM-IV describes the use of the GAF Score in the following way:
  > Axis V is for reporting the clinician's judgment of the individual's overall level of functioning. this information is useful in planning treatment and measuring its impact, and in predicting outcome
- the reporting of overall functioning on Axis V is done using the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale. the GAF scale may be particularly useful in tracking the clinical progress of individuals in global terms, using a single measure. the GAF Scale is to be rated with respect only to psychological, social, and occupational functioning. the instructions specify, "Do not include impairment in the functioning due to physical (or environmental) limitations."
- _Axis V - Global Assessment of Functioning_
- _DSM V - 2013 - GAF was eliminated_
- 2005 PDRS, p. 1-12 -- 1-16
  > Psychiatric impairment shall be evaluated by the physicican using the Global Assessment of Function (GAF) scale shown below. The resultant GAF score shall then be converted to a whole person impairment rating using the GAF conversion table...\[91-100 (superior functioning) -- 1-10 (persistent danger of severely hurting self or others OR persistent inability to maintain minimal personal hygiene OR serious suicidal act); 0 = inadequate information\]
- p. 1-16 includes the GAF conversion table
- GAF from the doctor's assessment (Axis V diagnosis) is converted to WPI
- the two most frequently used GAF ranges in workers comp:
  - 60 -- 51 moderate symptoms (e.g. flat affect and circumstantial speech, occasional panic attacks) OR moderate difficulty in social occupation, or school functioning (e.g. few friends, conflicts with peers or co-workers)
  - 70 -- 61 some mild symptoms (e.g. depressed mood and mild insomnia) OR some difficulty in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g. occasional truancy, or theft within the household), but generally functioning pretty well, has some meaningful relationships
  - 80 - 71 if symptoms are present, they are transient and expectable reactions to psycho-social stressors (e.g. difficulty concentrating after family argument); no more than slight impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g. temporarily falling behind in schoolwork)
- the American Psychiatric Association also publishes a Desk Reference to the Diagnostic Criteria from DSM-IV-TR. on p. 3 of that desk reference, severity "specifiers" are provided

  - mild. few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are present, and symptoms result in no more than minor impairment in social or occupational functioning
  - moderate. symptoms or functional impairment between "mild" and "severe" are present
  - severe. many symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis, or several symptoms that are particularly severe, are present, or the symptoms results in marked impairment in social or occupational functioning

- the AMA Guides, in table 14-1 p. 363, describes classes of impairment
  - class 1 - no impairment
  - class 2 - mild -- impairment levels are compatible with most useful functioning
  - class 3 - moderate - impairment levels are compatible with some, but not all, useful functioning
  - class 4 - marked -- impairment levels significantly impede useful functioning
- 4 areas to be evaluated:
  1. ability to perform activities of daily living
  2. social functioning
  3. concentration, persistence and pace
  4. deterioration or decompensation in work or work-like setting/adaptation

### Rating Issues (Guzman)

> In order to constitute substantial medical evidence, a medical opinion must be predicated on reasonable medical probability. Also, a medical opinion is not substantial evidence if it is based on facts no longer germane, on adequate medical histories or examination, on incorrect legal theories, or on surmise, speculation, conjecture, or guess. Further, a medical report is not substantial evidence unless it sets forth the reasoning behind the physician's opinion, not merely his or her conclusions.

- the 6th District Court of Appeal's response to the Milpitas School District's Petition for Review of Guzman on 8/19/10

## Continuous Traumas

- 2005-2007 8% indemnity claims = CT
- 2014 18% indemnity claims = CT
- 7000 CTs between 7/12 - 4/16 (7.5% of all claims)
- 336 CT claims exceeding $1 million
- **3208.1** an injury may be either:
  a. **"specific"** occurring as the result of one incident or exposure which causes disability or need for medical treatment; or
  b. **"cumulative"** occurring as reptitive mentally or physically tramatic activities extending over a period of time, the combined effect of which casues any disability or need for medical treatment...
- **LC 5412 -- Continuous Trauma** - the date of injury in cases of occupational diseases or cumulative injuries is that date upon which the employee **first suffered disability** therefrom **and** either **knew**, **or** in the exercise of reasonable diligence **should have known, that such disability was caused by** his present or prior **employment**.
  > Modified work alone is not sufficient basis for compensable **temporary disability**, since actual wage loss is required for **temporary disability**, but it may indicate permanent impairment of earning capacity, especially if the work is never able to return to the original job duties.
  > \[M\]edical treatment alone is not **disability**, but it may be evidence of compensable **permanent disability**, as may a need for modified work
  > These questions, which may require expert medical opinion, are for the trier of fact to determine.
- LC 5500.5
  - applies to both "occupational disease" and "continuous trauma", no difference
    > liability for the cumulative injury or occupational disease shall not be apportioned to prior or subsequent years
    > In any case involving a claim of occupational disease or cumulative injury occurring as a result of more than one employment within the appropriate time period set forth in subdivision (a), the employee making the claim, or his or her dependents, may elect to proceed against any one or more of the employers.
  - NOTE: 5500.5 is very long and will not be entirely typed out here
- Contribution SOL
  > after the appeals board has made an award for compensation benefits in connection with an occupational disease of cumulative injury, any employer or insurance carrier held liable under the award may institute proceedings before the board for the purpose of determining the apportionment of liability or right of contribution
- "award for compensation benefits"
  - can be **UNTIMELY**, even if:
    - award not final award as to "all benefits"

- apportionment
  - PD (CTS, etc) due to:
    - 70% AOE/COE: grasp/manip/push/pull
    - 30% Non-AOE/COE: "regular activities of life"
      > \[The AME's\] apportionment of PD to \[ADLs\], referring to such things as driving and moving furniture once in a while, appears vague and speculative; indeed, should this become the accepted standard, _it would be difficult to obtain an award without apportionment in almost every case, unless the worked lived a totally immobile life whenever not at work._ CWCR (Vol. 35, No. 4) It appears that so long as the appropriate magic words are used, such as 'best medical judgment,', 'reasonable medical probability,' and 'medical expertise,' ...virtually anything can be a permissible basis for apportionment.
