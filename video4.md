# AMA Impairment Rating

## Work Comp Defense Prep

AMA Guides used to "determine impairment, the Legislature furthered its expressly stated goal of achieving 'consistency, uniformity, and objectivity'" - _Almaraz Guzman 09/03/2009_

### Almaraz Guzman

- rating not automatic
- must be substantial evidence
- within four corners of AMA Guides
- physician rationale required

### Chapter 15: The Spine

- spine structure
  - cervical (8)
  - thoracic (12)
  - lumbar (5)
  - sacrum
  - coccyx
  - motion segment = 2 adjacent vertebrae, intervertebral disc, facet joints, and ligemtous structure
- radiculopathy
  - defined as significant alteration in the function of a nerve root or nerve roots and is usually caused by pressure on one or several nerve roots
  - "diagnosis requires a dermatomal distribution of pain, numbness, and/or pareshesias in a dermatomal distribution. A root tension sign is usually positive. The diagnosis of herniated disk must be substantiated by an appropriate finding on an imaging study. The presence of findings on an imaging study in and of itself does not make the diagnosis of radiculopathy. There must also be clinical evidence" (p. 382)
  - "It is important to note that a positive imaging study in and of itself does not make the diagnosis...An imaging study alone is insufficient to qualify for a DRE category. Individuals with electromyography (EMG) studies that are clearly positive support a diagnosis of radiculopathy and therefore qualify for at least DRE caregory III." (p. 378)
  - herniated disc
  - compression fracture
- DRE method of evaluation
  - the principle methodoly used to evaluate an individual who has had a distinct injury
  - criteria
    - single level involvement
    - corticospine injury
- ROM method of evaluation
  - criteria
    - multi-level or bilateral radiculopathy
    - multi-level surgery
    - multi-level AOMSI
    - multi-level fracture
    - recurrent radiculopathy
- impairment evaluations are performed after the injured worker attains MMI
- DRE Categories
  1. subjective findings only
  2. muscle guarding, spasm/asymmetric ROM, unverified radiculopathy, resolved verified radiculopathy
  3. unresolved verified radiculopathy, spine surgery level one
  4. alteration motion segment integrity (fusion), bilateral or multi-level radiculopathy (cervical, thoracic spines)
  5. alteration motion segment integrity with radiculopathy
- symptoms, signs, & tests
  - muscle guarding
  - muscle spasm
  - asymmetry of spinal motion
  - non-verifiable radicular root pain
  - fractures
    - compression of one vertebral body
    - posterior element fracture without dislocation
    - a spinous or transverse process fracture
  - radiculopathy
    - no history of radiculopathy
    - resolved radiculopathy w/o surgery
    - resolved radiculopathy w/ surgery
    - radiculopathy at MMI
  - surgeries
  - aleration of motion segment integrity
    - fusion
    - instability - increased translational or angular motion

### ROM Method

- when to use?
  - impairment caused by illness, not specific (or CT) injury, or cause is uncertain
  - statutorily mandated
  - multilevel involvement in the same region
  - multilevel alteration of motion segment integrity (AOMSI) - fusions
- criteria
  - multi-level or bilateral radiculopathy
  - multi-level surgery
  - multi-level AOMSI
  - multi-level fracture
  - recurrent radiculopathy
- consists of 3 elements
  1. range of motion of the impaired spine region
  - two - inclinometer technique
  - physician should seek consistency
    - inconsistent results are repeated
    - disregard if results remain inconsistent
  - should match known pathology
  - at least three measurements for each motion
  - greatest measurement used for impairment
  - lumbar flexion requires sacral (hip) flexion angle -- accessory validity test -- p. 406
  - all impairments within same region are added
  2. accompanying diagnosis
  - all impairment found in table 15-7, p. 404
    - four sections (disorders), if more than one applies, use the one providing greatest impairment
    - table only used when the ROM method is used
  - always read footnotes
  - when multiple levels involved, impairment added for additional levels only
  3. spinal nerve deficit
  - motor
  - sensory
  - not always applicable; if not addressed, look for sensory or motor complaints
  - use tables on p. 424
    - tables 15-17 and 15-18 provide extremity impairment, not WPI
  - not frequently used by doctors
  - process used is similar to:
    - peripheral nerve disorders in extremities
    - strength loss in shoulder and elbow
  - nerve impairments are adjusted separately
- spinal nerve procedure
  - identify nerve(s) involved
  - determine grade/deficit (tables 15-15 and 15-16)
  - obtain maximum value (tables 15-17 and 15-18)
  - for sensory and motor deficits
    - multiply maximum value by % deficit
    - repeat for each nerve involved
    - combine all sensory impairments at extremity level
    - convert to WPI
  - adjust sensory and motor deficit separately
- combining rules for ROM method
  - may have as many as 4 WPI values
    - loss of motion
    - accompanying diagnosis
    - spinal nerve deficit - sensory
    - spinal nerve deficit - motor
  - combine loss of motion and accompanying diagnosis at WPI level, adjust
  - adjust sensory impairment
  - adjust motor impairment
  - combine

### DRE or ROM

- DRE
  - single level
  - corticospinal tract
- ROM
  - multilevel: surgery, fracture, AOMSI
  - radiculopathy that is:
    - multilevel
    - bilateral
    - recurrent

## Chapter 16: Upper Extremities

### Conversion Digit Values to Hand Value

- thumb 40%
- index 20%
- middle 20%
- ring 10%
- little 10%
- hand 100%
- conversion table 16-1 digit to hand (p. 438)

### Conversion

- 100% upper extremity (UE) = 60% WPI
- 100% hand = 90% UE = 54% WPI
- 100% thumb = 40% hand = 36% UE = 22% WPI
- 100% index/middle = 20% hand = 18% UE = 11% WPI
- 100% ring/little = 10% hand = 9% UE = 5% WPI

### 7 Methods in AMA Guide

#### Amputations (p. 441-445)

- assess level of amputation
- thumb amputation at MP joint = 100% thumb, 40% hand, 36% UE, 22% WPI
- little finger at PIP joint = 80% digit, 8% hand, 7% UE, 4% WPI
- humerus at proximal to deltoid tubercle level (axillary fold) = 100% UE, 60% WPI
- amputation at scapulothoracic level (forequarter) = 70% WPI
- "The most practical and useful approach to evaluating impairment of a digit is to compare the current loss of function with the loss resulting from amputation." (p. 434 AMA Guides)
- "The composite rating for an extremity (after adjustments) may not exceed the amputation value of the extremity adjusted for earning capacity, occupation and age." (p. 1-11 2005 PDRS)

#### Digital Nerve Lesions (section 16.3)

- not to be used for peripheral nerve disorders or CRPS
- sensibility defects on the dorsal surfaces of the digits are not considered impairing
- "The sensory quality is based on the results of the two-point discrimination test carried out over the distal palmar area of the digit, or on the most distal part of the stump in the presence of a partial amputation." (p. 446)
- doctor must provide three pieces of information ti properly determine impairment due to digital nerve lesion
  1. sensory loss (two-point discrimination)
  2. percentage of digit length affected
  3. digital nerve involvement (longitudinal - ulnar or radial or transverse - both). The information is then used with table 16-6 (p. 448 thumb and little finger) or table 16-7 (p. 448 index, middle, and ring fingers) to determine impairment.

#### ROM/Ankylosis

neutral position
: 0 degrees = "full extension" (not 180 degrees)

flexion
: F

extension
: E "motion opposite to flexion"

extension lag
: incomplete extension from a flexed position to the neutral starting point

hyperextension
: extension exceeding the zero starting position

ankylosis
: complete loss of motion of a joint = F + E

plus sign
: + joint hyperextension

minus sign
: - extension lag

arc of motion
: degrees traced between the two extreme positions of movement in a specific plane (F to E)

unit of motion
: joint has more than one plane of movement, each is referred to as a unit of motion

functional position
: the least impairing angle for fusion

- measurement hints
  - "both extremities should be compared" (p. 451)
    - if uninvolved "normal" contralateral joint has less than normal ROM, subtract its ROM from impaired joint
    - if uninvolved has greater than normal ROM, may correct up to 2% of max. regional impairment rating
- motion impairment calculation
  - motion impairment pie charts are used for motion calculatioin of a **specific joint**
  - the impairment values derived for each are **added together** to obtain the total motion impairment of a **specific joint**
  - thumb ray has three articular units: IP, MP, and CMC. add the impairment values contributed by each motion unit (p. 460)
  - fingers have three functional units: DIP, PIP, and MP each calculate as a specific joint. combine the finger impairments from each joint
  - IF two or more digits are involved, calculate separately the total digit impairment for each
  - use table 16-1 convert each digit to hand impairment
  - add hand impairment values from each digit to obtain total hand impairment
  - if thumb amputation is proximal to MP joint (CMC joint) the other digits are converted to UE, then added to the UE value for the thumb ray
- thumb injury and total transverse loss of IP joint
  - IP joint = 50% digit length
  - figure 16-6 (p. 447) = 25% digit
  - table 16-6 (p. 448) = 25% digit
- total transverse sensory loss @ MP joint middle finger
  - 50% digit (fig. 16-7 p. 447)
  - 10% hand (p. 438)
  - 9% UE (p. 439)
  - 5% WPI (p. 439)

#### Peripheral Nerve Disorders (p. 480-497)

- evaluates
  - impairments related to disorders of the spinal nerves (C5 to C8 and T1)
  - brachial plexus
  - major peripheral nerves of the UE
  - entrapment/compression neuropathy
  - complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)
- underlying causes
  - diabetes mellitus
  - chronic alcohol abuse
  - systemic neurological disorders
  - hypothyroidism and other systemic disease
  - if any of the above, apportionment
- evaluation principles (p. 480)
  - sensory deficits in the digits strictly due to lesions of digital nerves are evaluated by section 16.3
  - impairments relating to the spinal cord and central nervous system are considered in chapters 13 and 15 of the guides
  - impairment due to chronic pain discussed in chapter 18
  - when an impairment results strictly from a peripheral nerve lesion, in the absence of CRPS, the motion values derived from seciton 16.4 are not applied to this section to avoid duplication or unwarranted increase in the impairment estimation
- evaluation methods
  1. ID nerve involved (doctor's job)
  2. grade sensory loss w/ table 16-10 (doctor's job)
  3. grade motor loss (doctor's job)
  4. ID max sensory value (you can do)
  5. ID max motor value (you can do)
  6. multiply sensory grade by max sensory value
  7. multiply motor grade by max motor value
  8. combine sensory w/ motor
  9. convert: UE to WPI
- RED FLAGS
  - decreased pinch strength
  - decreased grip strength
  - sensory deficits due to digital nerve lesions
  - "In compression neuropathies, additional impairment values are not given for decreased grip strength. In the absence of CRPS, additional impairment values are not given for decreased motion." (p. 494)
- entrapment at median nerve at wrist -> carpal tunnel and ulnar nerve at elbow -> cubital tunnel are most typical
- carpal tunnel syndome post-operative (p. 495)
  1. positive clinical findings of median nerve dysfunction and electrical conduction delay(s)
  2. normal sensibility/strength w/ abnormal sensory and/or motor latencies or abnormal EMG testing = rating not to exceed 5% UE (3% WPI)
  3. normal sensibility, opposition strength, nerve conduction studies = 0% UE
- complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS p. 495-498)
  - reflex sympathetic dystrophy (CRPS I)
  - causalgia (CRPS II)
  - burning pain w/o stimulation or movement
  - "The diagnosis of the syndromes should be conservative and based on objective findings." (p. 496)
  - at least eight of the findings must be present concurrently for a diagnosis (p. 496)

#### Peripheral Vascular Disease

- usually involves diseases of arteries, veins and lymphatic disorders
- vascular disorders cause...
  - reduced blood flow
  - intermittent claudication
  - pain at rest
  - ulcers
  - gangrene
  - extremity loss
  - raynaud's phenomenon
- physical signs of vascular damage must be present and are the primary determinants in placing the examinee into one of these categories

#### Strength (p. 507-510)

- grip & pinch strength
- manual muscle testing
- "Because strength measurements are functional tests influenced by sunjective factors that are difficult to control and the Guides for the most part is based on anatomic impairment, the Gudies does not assign a large role to such measurements." (p. 507)
- strength impairment is only provided in the "rare case" (p. 508)
- strength loss can be combined w/ other impairments "only if based on unrelated etiologic or pathomechanical causes." (p. 508)
- decreased strength cannot be rated in the presence of decreased motion, painful conditions, deformities, or absence of parts (e.g. thumb amputation) that prevent effective application of maximal force in the region being evaluated.
- "motor weakness associated with disorders of the peripheral nerve system and various degenerative neuromuscular conditions are evaluated according to guidelines described in section 16.5..." (p. 508)
- "strength can only be applied as a measure when a year or more has passed since the time of injury or surgery." (p. 508)
- "manual muscle testing of major groups is used for testing strength about the elbow and shoulder." (p. 508)
- "if there is more than 20% variation in the readings, one may assume the individual is not exerting full effort." (p. 508)
- "results of strength testing should be repoducible on different occasions or by two or more trained observers." (p. 509)
- tendinitis
  - "several syndromes involving UE are variously attributed to tendinitis, fasciitis, or epicondylitis. the most common of these are the stubborn conditions of the origins of the flexor and extensor muscle of the forearm where they attach to the medial and lateral epicondyles of the humerus. although these conditions may be persistent for some time, they are not given a permanent impairment rating unless there is some other factor that must be considered." (p. 507)
  - grip loss can be considered "if an individual has had tendon rupture or has under-gone surgical release of the flexor or extensor origins or medial or lateral epicondylitis, or has had excision of the epicondyle, there may be some permanent weakness of grip as a result fo the tendon rupture of the surgery. in this case, impairment can be given on the basis of weakness of grip strength according to section 16.8b." (p. 507)

#### "Other" Disorders (497-507)

- only used when other criteria have not adequately encompassed the impairment
- the severity of impairment due to these disorders is rated separately according to tables 16-19 through 16-30 and then multiplied by the relative maximum value fo the unit involved as specified in table 16-18 (p. 498)
- synovial hypertrophy cannot be combined with other methods: "if synovial hypertrophy is the only finding, the joint impairment is rated according to table 16-19 and multiplied by the relative maximum value of the joint involved (table 16-18). it cannot be combined with impairment due to decreased joint motion or other findings." (p. 500)
- shoulder instability
  - must be thoroughly documented: "shoulder instability, recurrent subluxation, or dislocation must be adequately documented through a complete medical history, physical examination, and radiographic findings. MRI, arthroscopy, and examination under anesthesia may be useful components of the evaluation. An individual's complaint of feeling or fearing that a joint is 'popping' or 'going out of place' without adequate clinical findings is not a basis for permanent impairment rating." (p. 504)
  - shoulder representing 60% of UE (table 16-18), the patterns of occult(10%), subluxating (20%), and disclocating (40%) instabilities represent UE impairments of 6%, 12%, and 24% respectively (p. 504)
  - shoulder instability impairment can only be combined with decreased motion impairment: "this value may be combined only with impairments due to decreased motion (section 16.4). pain and decreased muscle strength are not rated separately." (p. 504)

## Chapter 17: Lower Extremity (LE)

- 100% LE = 40% WPI (table 17-3 p. 527)
- 100% foot = 70% LE
- numbers that are put together for evaluation for impairment/pd must be either added or combined
  - **COMBINE** unless specific instructions state to **ADD** impairment values. the effect/purpose of combining is that it prevents the combined value from exceeding 100 (A + B(1-A) where A and B are decimal equivalents)
  - **ADD** when involving the evaluation of range of motion impairment for the same part of the body
- how to combine (p. 1-11 2005 PDRS):
  - multiple impairments such as those involving a single part of an extremity, e.g. two impairment involving a shoulder such as shoulder instability and limited range of motion, are ocmbined at the UE level, then converted to WPI and adjusted before being combined with other parts of the same extremity
  - impairments w/ disability numbers in the 16.01 and 17.01 series are converted to whole person impairment and adjusted before being combined with any other impairment of the same extremity
  - impairment of an individual extremity are adjusted and combined at the whole person (PD) level with other impairments of the same extremity before being combined w/ impairments of other body parts. e.g. an impairment of the left knee and ankle would be combined before further combination w/ an impairment of the opposing leg or the back

### Methods Used to Evaluate Impairments of LE

#### Limb Length Discrepency

- x-rays strongly recommended
- repeat 3 times, "averaged to reduce measurement error" (p. 528)

#### Gait Derangement

- "expect as otherwise noted...table 17-5 \[is\] for full-time gait derangement of persons who are dependent on assistive devices."
- not for "abnormalities based only on subjective factors, such as pain or sudden giving-way, as with...an individual with low-back discomfort who chooses to use a cane to assist in walking."
- **should only be used when no other method is available to rate the person**

#### Muscle Atrophy (Unilateral)

- at thigh 10cm above patella
- calf at "max level"
- must compare measurement to opposite, uninjured LE
- combine thigh and calf atrophy
- atrophy measurements
  - compare measurement to opposite member
  - different in circumference might be:
    - swelling
    - varicose veins
    - opposite member injured
- example
  - right tibia fracture
  - MMI
  - pain-free walking
  - right thigh atrophy = 2cm -> 8% LE = 3% WPI
  - right calf atrophy = 1cm -> 3% LE = 1% WPI
  - combine: 8% C 3% = 11 LE
  - convert 11% LE = 4% WPI

#### Manual Muscle Testing

- tables 17-7 and 17-8 (p. 531-532)
- note type - hip abduction, grade 3 = 37% LE
- cautions (p. 531)
  - "depends on the examinee's cooperation"
  - "should be concordant with other...signs and medical evidence"
  - more than one grade between examiners
  - more than one grade from exam to exam
  - pain
  - fear of pain
  - attributed to deficit of a peripheral nerve

#### Range of Motion

- p. 533-538
- use only "if it is clear...restricted \[ROM\] has an organic basis..."
- obtain 3 measurements; use greatest
- **add** ROM impairments in joint
- example
  - ankle flexion of 6° = 6% WPI (15% LE) (table 17-11, p. 537)
  - ankle extension of 5° = 3% WPI (7% LE) (table 17-11)
  - 1cm calf atrophy = 1% WPI (table 17-6, p. 530)
  - add flexion and extension -> 15% LE + 7% LE = 22% LE = 9% WPI
  - do not use atrophy (1% WPI)
- invalid if:
  - class inconsistency between 2 observers
  - class inconsistency between exams
  - pain
  - fear of pain

#### Ankylosis

- hip = 50% LE = 20% WPI (p. 538)
- knee = 67% LE = 27% WPI (p. 540)
- ankle = 14% foot = 10% LE = 4% WPI (p. 541)
- toes (see table 17-30 p. 543)

1. determine value for "optimal position"
2. use tables (p. 538-543) for deviation values (malposition increases impairment)
3. **add** multiple malpositions for same join
4. **combine** ankylosis of different joints
5. "the baseline rating for ankylosis in a neutral position is used only once for each joint."

#### Arthritis

- use x-rays "standing if possible" with table 17-31 (p. 544)
- () = normal cartilage intervals
- compare **uninjured** opposite member
- 17-31 footnote states if:
  1. direct trauma,
  2. patellofemoral pain (between knee cap and thigh bone/femur), and
  3. "crepitation" on physical exam;
  4. no joint space narrowing => 2% WPI (5% LE)
- the knee has a medial and lateral compartment
  - only the more significant loss is used (can be combined w/ patellofemoral arthritis)

#### Amputations

- see table 17-32 (p. 545)

#### Diagnoses-Based Estimates

- see table 17-33 (used in 70-80% of LE cases)
- covers 9 regions/conditions
  1. pelvis
  2. hip
  3. femoral shaft fracture
  4. knee
  5. malalignment of tibial shaft fracture
  6. ankle
  7. hindfoot
  8. midfoot deformity
  9. forefoot deformity

#### Skin Loss (p. 550)

- see table 17-36
- full-thickness skin loss: impairment "even when the areas are successfully covered with \[a\]...skin graft."
- chronic osteomyelitis (bone infection, usually bacterial infection of bone marrow; resulting inflammation can lead to reduction of blood supply to bone) **too**

#### Peripheral Nerve Injuries (p. 550-552)

- table 17-37 - maximum impairment values
- assessed sensory/motor deficits are applied
- combine with other LE methods **except**:
  - muscle weakness
  - atrophy
  - gait (p. 552)
- dysethesia (p. 600)
  - impairment of sensitivity, especially to touch. altered feelings, such as burning, wetness, electric shock, pins and needles, itching

#### Causalgia & CRPS (p. 553)

- CRPS I = RSD
- CRPS II = causalgia
- "characterized by pain, swelling, stiffness, discoloraiton...skeletal demineralization"
- may follow a sprain, fracture or nerve or vascular injury
- "to rate \[causalgia and RSD\]..., diagnosis is key..."
  - diagnosis: rely on clinical findings, three-phase bone scan, x-rays, laser Doppler flowmetry, sudomotor reflex
  - table 16-16 (p. 496)

#### Vascular Disorders (p. 553-554)

**intermittent claudication**
: cramping or aching in the calves (sometimes the thighs or buttocks) caused by walking; relieved by rest; a manifestation of atherosclerosis (blockage of an artery). it is called "intermittent" because of the pattern of pain only with walking.

**edema**
: abnormal buildup of fluid in the ankles, feet and legs.

- common causes
  - prolonged standing
  - long airplane flights or automobile rides
  - menstrual periods (for some women)
  - pregnancy
  - being overweight
  - increased age
  - injury or trauma

## AMA Guides "Red Flags" & Tricks of the Trade

### I. Combining

- combine values chart (p. 604)
- method used to combine multiple impairments, derived from the formula A + B(1-A) = _combined_ values of A and B
- ensures that the summary value will not exceed 100% whole person
- say goodbye to MDT (multiple disability table)
- all impairments are:
  - converted to WPI
  - adjusted for FEC, age and occupation
  - combined

#### Combine or Add, and CVC

- numbers that are put together for evaluation of impairment/pd must be either added or combined
- **COMBINE**
  - for most situations - unless specific instructions state to ADD impairment values
  - atrophy (17-4, p. 531)
  - strength (17-5, p. 532)
  - arthritis (knee - patellofemoral w/ knee, lateral or medial compartment, if applicable)
  - peripheral nerve (p. 550)
  - combine largest to smallest (ignore instructions elsewhere)
- **ADD**
  - the most notable exception to combining = ROM for the same part of the body
  - ROM for the same part of the body (p. 533)

#### Combined Values Chart

- use chart in PDRS (section 8)
- the combined values chart in the AMA Guides has 5 errors (p. 604-606)
  - 54 c 12 = 60 (not 59)
  - 58 c 25 = 69 (not 68)
  - 94 c 78 = 99 (not 98)
  - 95 c 30 = 97 (not 96)
  - 95 c 34 = 97 (not 96)

#### UE and LE Impairments (per PDRS)

- extremity impairments are:
  - adjusted for FEC, age, occupation
  - combined with other impairments of _same_ extremity before combining extremity impairments with other body parts

#### Pain Add-On

- max is 3% WPI
- 3% can be subdivided between different impairments
- add impairments to WPI value for affected body part(s) before adjustments

### II. Measuring Decreased Ability to "Work" vs. "Impairment"

**impairment**
: loss, loss of use, or derangement of any body part, organ system or organ function. measured against impact on activities of daily living (ADL); measured by AMA Guides

**disability**
: effect of impairment on ability to meet occupational demands. measured against earning capacity loss; measured by California PD Schedule

#### Whole Person Impairment

- does not measure "disability" or "P.D."
- 90% WPI may = 100% PD
- "the Guides is not intended to be used for direct estimates of work disability."
- impairment percentages derived according to the Guides criteria do not measure work disability
- "\[I\]t is inappropriate to use the Guides' criteria or ratings to make direct estimates of work disability." (p. 9)

#### Adjustments for Lack of Treatment

- "If a patients declines \[surgical, pharmacologic or therapeutic treatment of an impairment\], that decision neither decreased nor increases the estimated percentage of...impairment." (p. 20)
- ^ **WRONG! (see _Hanker_ below)**

#### Pain

- "If the individual appears to have pain-related impairment that has increased the burden of his or her condition slightly, the examiner may increase the percentage...by up to 3%." (p. 573)
- NOT automatic
- 3% per injury
- chapter 18 analysis required
- "impairment ratings in the Guides already have accounted for pain" (p. 570)
- "\[I\]f an examining physician determines...an individual has pain-related impairment, \[must decide whether\]...that impairment has already been adequately incorporated into the rating..." (p. 570)
- pain chapter **NOT** used for:
  1. conditions adequately rated using other chapter(s)
  2. low credibility/unwilling or unable to provide information
  3. "ambiguous or controversial pain syndromes"
  4. myofascial pain
  5. fibromyalgia
  6. "disputed neurogenic"
  7. thoracic outlet syndrome
- "the judgment that pain-related impairment is unratable does not mean that the evaluating physician considers the pain to be 'unreal' or fabricated." (p. 572)
- rate pain if:
  1. "body system impairment rating" is inadequate, and
  2. pain increased "burden of condition" slightly
  3. if the above are true, "may increase...by up to 3%"
- if pain increases burden "substantially":
  1. perform formal pain assessment
  2. tables 18-4 and 18-6
  3. detemrine class
  4. ratable?
  5. if ratable, "award" up to 3%
- the schedule (p. 1-12) is **WRONG!**
  - not "addition"
  - the pain-related impairment is combined with the conventional impairment
  - see errata (p. 584 \[5(b)-(c)\] and p. 589 \["impairment rating" (2)\])

### IV. AMA "Treatment" Rules Conflict With Labor Code/Case Law

- LC 4056:

  > No compensation is payable in case of the death or disability of an employee when his death is caused, or when and so far as his disability is caused, continued, or aggrevated by an unreasonable refusal to submit to medical treatment, or to any surgical treatment, if the risk of the treatment is, in the opinion of the appeals board, based upon expert medical or surgical advice, inconsiderable in view of the seriousness of the injury.

- adjustments for lack of treatment

  > If a patient declines \[surgical, pharmacologic or therapeutic treatment of an impairment\], that decision neither decreased nor increases the estimated percentage of...impairment. (p. 20)

- _Hanker v. City of Stockton PD_
  - CT to heart; extreme fatigue: difficult to function
  - 2 treatment options
    1. medication (80% WPI)
    2. ablation procedure (0%)

### V. ROM (rather than DRE)

- not valued
  - spondylolysis
  - spondylolisthesis
  - herniated disc w.o radiculopathy (why?)
  - aging changes (why?)
- two methods of spinal evaluation
  - DRE - "primary method"
  - ROM - only if exception to DRE exists
- not sufficient
  - "ROM provides greater PD"
  - "ROM is fairer"
  - "ROM more accurately reflects PD" (violate Guzman?)
  - silence (not golden)
- ROM if:
  - cause not clear
  - statutorily mandated (not in california)
  - "multilevel involvement in the same spinal region"
    - not multilevel DDD
    - not multilevel 'bulges'
    - not multilevel herniations w/o radiculopathy
    - multilevel fractures
    - multilevel herniations _with_ radiculopathy
    - multilevel stenosis _with_ radiculopathy
    - DEU position - multi-level
      - multi-level bulges, degernative changes or herniations != ROM
      - need multi-level (or bilateral) radiculopathy
  - "alteration of motion segment integrity at multiple levels"
    - fusions
  - "recurrent radiculopathy"
    - requirements:
      - imaging study confirmation (MRI)
      - "significant" impact on nerve root function
      - "dermatomal distribution"/clinical confirmation
  - multiple episodes of "alteration of motion segment integrity"
    - increased translational motion
    - increased angular motion
    - decreased motion from:
      - developmental fusion
      - healed fracture
      - healed infection
      - arthrodesis

### VI. Grip/Pinch Mistakes

- UE strength evaluation (p. 507-510)
  - grip & pinch strength
  - manual muscle testing
- **RED FLAGS**

  > Because strength measurements are...influenced by subective factors...the Guides does not assign a large role to such measurements.
  > Many subjective...factors, including fatigure, handedness, time of day, age, nutritional state, pain...cooperation...influence strength measurements.
  > \[T\]he correlation of strength with performance of activities of daily living is poor...increased strength does not necessarily equate with increased function

- when grip/pinch can be used
  - in a "rare case" (p. 508, AMA Guides 5th)
  - not in presence of "painful conditions"
  - not in presence of "decreased motions"
  - not in presence of "deformities"
  - not if there is an "absence of parts"
  - not for elbow, shoulder injuries
  - not within 1 year of injury/surgery
  - not if >20% variation
  - not if "evidence \[of\] less than maximal effort" (p. 509, AMA Guides 5th)
  - not to rate carpal tunnel (p. 595)

### VII. Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS p. 495-498)

- reflex sympathetic dystrophy (CRPS I)
- casualgia (CRPS II)
- burning pain w/o stimulation or movement
- plan on LIFE PENSION
- consider psyche injury

> \[T\]he diagnosis of the syndromes should be conservative and based on objective findings. p. 496
> At least eight of \[the\] findings \[in table 16-16, p. 496\] must be present concurrently for a diagnosis of CRPS.

### VIII. Carpal Tunnel

**entrapment neuropathy**
: a nerve compression-type lesion that implies disproportion between the volume of the peripheral nerve and the space through which it passes.

- causes
  - pressure on the median nerve
  - caused by anything reducing space in carpal tunnel
  - repetitive, forceful grasping with hands
  - repitive bending of the wrist
  - vibrating tools
  - hormonal changes
- conditions that may play a role
  - arthritis
  - diabetes
  - thyroid imbalance
  - broken or dislocated bones in the wrist that cause swelling
  - tunnel size
  - heredity
    - genes account for about half of cases!
    - much higher risk in women who have an identical twin w/ disorder compared to those w/o
  - metabolic diseases
  - autoimmune diseases
  - pregnancy
  - body weight
