# AMA Impairment Rating

## Work Comp Defense Prep

AMA Guides used to "determine impairment, the Legislature furthered its expressly stated goal of achieving 'consistency, uniformity, and objectivity'" - _Almaraz Guzman 09/03/2009_

### Almaraz Guzman

- rating not automatic
- must be substantial evidence
- within four corners of AMA Guides
- physician rationale required

### Chapter 15: The Spine

- spine structure
  - cervical (8)
  - thoracic (12)
  - lumbar (5)
  - sacrum
  - coccyx
  - motion segment = 2 adjacent vertebrae, intervertebral disc, facet joints, and ligemtous structure
- radiculopathy
  - defined as significant alteration in the function of a nerve root or nerve roots and is usually caused by pressure on one or several nerve roots
  - "diagnosis requires a dermatomal distribution of pain, numbness, and/or pareshesias in a dermatomal distribution. A root tension sign is usually positive. The diagnosis of herniated disk must be substantiated by an appropriate finding on an imaging study. The presence of findings on an imaging study in and of itself does not make the diagnosis of radiculopathy. There must also be clinical evidence" (p. 382)
  - "It is important to note that a positive imaging study in and of itself does not make the diagnosis...An imaging study alone is insufficient to qualify for a DRE category. Individuals with electromyography (EMG) studies that are clearly positive support a diagnosis of radiculopathy and therefore qualify for at least DRE caregory III." (p. 378)
  - herniated disc
  - compression fracture
- DRE method of evaluation
  - the principle methodoly used to evaluate an individual who has had a distinct injury
  - criteria
    - single level involvement
    - corticospine injury

  - criteria
    - multi-level or bilateral radiculopathy
    - multi-level surgery
    - multi-level AOMSI

  3. unresolved verified radiculopathy, spine surgery level one
  4. alteration motion segment integrity (fusion), bilateral or multi-level radiculopathy (cervical, thoracic spines)
  5. alteration motion segment integrity with radiculopathy
- symptoms, signs, & tests
  - muscle guarding
  - muscle spasm
  - asymmetry of spinal motion
  - non-verifiable radicular root pain
  - fractures
    - compression of one vertebral body
    - posterior element fracture without dislocation
    - a spinous or transverse process fracture
  - radiculopathy
    - no history of radiculopathy
    - resolved radiculopathy w/o surgery
    - resolved radiculopathy w/ surgery
    - radiculopathy at MMI
  - surgeries
  - aleration of motion segment integrity
    - fusion
    - instability - increased translational or angular motion

### ROM Method

- when to use?
  - impairment caused by illness, not specific (or CT) injury, or cause is uncertain
  - statutorily mandated
  - multilevel involvement in the same region
  - multilevel alteration of motion segment integrity (AOMSI) - fusions
- criteria
  - multi-level or bilateral radiculopathy
  - multi-level surgery
  - multi-level AOMSI
  - multi-level fracture
  - recurrent radiculopathy
- consists of 3 elements
  1. range of motion of the impaired spine region
  - two - inclinometer technique
  - physician should seek consistency
    - inconsistent results are repeated
    - disregard if results remain inconsistent
  - should match known pathology
  - at least three measurements for each motion
  - greatest measurement used for impairment
  - lumbar flexion requires sacral (hip) flexion angle -- accessory validity test -- p. 406
  - all impairments within same region are added
  2. accompanying diagnosis
  - all impairment found in table 15-7, p. 404
    - four sections (disorders), if more than one applies, use the one providing greatest impairment
    - table only used when the ROM method is used
  - always read footnotes
  - when multiple levels involved, impairment added for additional levels only
  3. spinal nerve deficit
  - motor
  - sensory
  - not always applicable; if not addressed, look for sensory or motor complaints
  - use tables on p. 424
    - tables 15-17 and 15-18 provide extremity impairment, not WPI
  - not frequently used by doctors
  - process used is similar to:
    - peripheral nerve disorders in extremities
    - strength loss in shoulder and elbow
  - nerve impairments are adjusted separately
- spinal nerve procedure
  - identify nerve(s) involved
  - determine grade/deficit (tables 15-15 and 15-16)
  - obtain maximum value (tables 15-17 and 15-18)
  - for sensory and motor deficits
    - multiply maximum value by % deficit
    - repeat for each nerve involved
    - combine all sensory impairments at extremity level
    - convert to WPI
  - adjust sensory and motor deficit separately
- combining rules for ROM method
  - may have as many as 4 WPI values
    - loss of motion
    - accompanying diagnosis
    - spinal nerve deficit - sensory
    - spinal nerve deficit - motor
  - combine loss of motion and accompanying diagnosis at WPI level, adjust
  - adjust sensory impairment
  - adjust motor impairment
  - combine

### DRE or ROM

- DRE
  - single level
  - corticospinal tract
- ROM
  - multilevel: surgery, fracture, AOMSI
  - radiculopathy that is:
    - multilevel
    - bilateral
    - recurrent

## Chapter 16: Upper Extremities

### Conversion Digit Values to Hand Value

- thumb 40%
- index 20%
- middle 20%
- ring 10%
- little 10%
- hand 100%
- conversion table 16-1 digit to hand (p. 438)

### Conversion

- 100% upper extremity (UE) = 60% WPI
- 100% hand = 90% UE = 54% WPI
- 100% thumb = 40% hand = 36% UE = 22% WPI
- 100% index/middle = 20% hand = 18% UE = 11% WPI
- 100% ring/little = 10% hand = 9% UE = 5% WPI

### 7 Methods in AMA Guide

#### Amputations (p. 441-445)

- assess level of amputation
- thumb amputation at MP joint = 100% thumb, 40% hand, 36% UE, 22% WPI
- little finger at PIP joint = 80% digit, 8% hand, 7% UE, 4% WPI
- humerus at proximal to deltoid tubercle level (axillary fold) = 100% UE, 60% WPI
- amputation at scapulothoracic level (forequarter) = 70% WPI
- "The most practical and useful approach to evaluating impairment of a digit is to compare the current loss of function with the loss resulting from amputation." (p. 434 AMA Guides)
- "The composite rating for an extremity (after adjustments) may not exceed the amputation value of the extremity adjusted for earning capacity, occupation and age." (p. 1-11 2005 PDRS)

#### Digital Nerve Lesions (section 16.3)

- not to be used for peripheral nerve disorders or CRPS
- sensibility defects on the dorsal surfaces of the digits are not considered impairing
- "The sensory quality is based on the results of the two-point discrimination test carried out over the distal palmar area of the digit, or on the most distal part of the stump in the presence of a partial amputation." (p. 446)
- doctor must provide three pieces of information ti properly determine impairment due to digital nerve lesion
  1. sensory loss (two-point discrimination)
  2. percentage of digit length affected
  3. digital nerve involvement (longitudinal - ulnar or radial or transverse - both). The information is then used with table 16-6 (p. 448 thumb and little finger) or table 16-7 (p. 448 index, middle, and ring fingers) to determine impairment.

#### ROM/Ankylosis

neutral position
: 0 degrees = "full extension" (not 180 degrees)

flexion
: F

extension
: E "motion opposite to flexion"

extension lag
: incomplete extension from a flexed position to the neutral starting point

hyperextension
: extension exceeding the zero starting position

ankylosis
: complete loss of motion of a joint = F + E

plus sign
: + joint hyperextension

minus sign
: - extension lag

arc of motion
: degrees traced between the two extreme positions of movement in a specific plane (F to E)

unit of motion
: joint has more than one plane of movement, each is referred to as a unit of motion

functional position
: the least impairing angle for fusion

- measurement hints
  - "both extremities should be compared" (p. 451)
    - if uninvolved "normal" contralateral joint has less than normal ROM, subtract its ROM from impaired joint
    - if uninvolved has greater than normal ROM, may correct up to 2% of max. regional impairment rating
- motion impairment calculation
  - motion impairment pie charts are used for motion calculatioin of a **specific joint**
  - the impairment values derived for each are **added together** to obtain the total motion impairment of a **specific joint**
  - thumb ray has three articular units: IP, MP, and CMC. add the impairment values contributed by each motion unit (p. 460)
  - fingers have three functional units: DIP, PIP, and MP each calculate as a specific joint. combine the finger impairments from each joint
  - IF two or more digits are involved, calculate separately the total digit impairment for each
  - use table 16-1 convert each digit to hand impairment
  - add hand impairment values from each digit to obtain total hand impairment
  - if thumb amputation is proximal to MP joint (CMC joint) the other digits are converted to UE, then added to the UE value for the thumb ray
- thumb injury and total transverse loss of IP joint
  - IP joint = 50% digit length
  - figure 16-6 (p. 447) = 25% digit
  - table 16-6 (p. 448) = 25% digit
- total transverse sensory loss @ MP joint middle finger
  - 50% digit (fig. 16-7 p. 447)
  - 10% hand (p. 438)
  - 9% UE (p. 439)
  - 5% WPI (p. 439)

#### Peripheral Nerve Disorders (p. 480-497)

- evaluates
  - impairments related to disorders of the spinal nerves (C5 to C8 and T1)
  - brachial plexus
  - major peripheral nerves of the UE
  - entrapment/compression neuropathy
  - complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)
- underlying causes
  - diabetes mellitus
  - chronic alcohol abuse
  - systemic neurological disorders
  - hypothyroidism and other systemic disease
  - if any of the above, apportionment
- evaluation principles (p. 480)
  - sensory deficits in the digits strictly due to lesions of digital nerves are evaluated by section 16.3
  - impairments relating to the spinal cord and central nervous system are considered in chapters 13 and 15 of the guides
  - impairment due to chronic pain discussed in chapter 18
  - when an impairment results strictly from a peripheral nerve lesion, in the absence of CRPS, the motion values derived from seciton 16.4 are not applied to this section to avoid duplication or unwarranted increase in the impairment estimation
- evaluation methods
  1. ID nerve involved (doctor's job)
  2. grade sensory loss w/ table 16-10 (doctor's job)
  3. grade motor loss (doctor's job)
  4. ID max sensory value (you can do)
  5. ID max motor value (you can do)
  6. multiply sensory grade by max sensory value
  7. multiply motor grade by max motor value
  8. combine sensory w/ motor
  9. convert: UE to WPI
- RED FLAGS
  - decreased pinch strength
  - decreased grip strength
  - sensory deficits due to digital nerve lesions
  - "In compression neuropathies, additional impairment values are not given for decreased grip strength. In the absence of CRPS, additional impairment values are not given for decreased motion." (p. 494)
- entrapment at median nerve at wrist -> carpal tunnel and ulnar nerve at elbow -> cubital tunnel are most typical
- carpal tunnel syndome post-operative (p. 495)
  1. positive clinical findings of median nerve dysfunction and electrical conduction delay(s)
  2. normal sensibility/strength w/ abnormal sensory and/or motor latencies or abnormal EMG testing = rating not to exceed 5% UE (3% WPI)
  3. normal sensibility, opposition strength, nerve conduction studies = 0% UE
- complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS p. 495-498)
  - reflex sympathetic dystrophy (CRPS I)
  - causalgia (CRPS II)
  - burning pain w/o stimulation or movement
  - "The diagnosis of the syndromes should be conservative and based on objective findings." (p. 496)
  - at least eight of the findings must be present concurrently for a diagnosis (p. 496)

5. peripheral vascular disease

- usually involves diseases of arteries, veins and lymphatic disorders
- vascular disorders cause...
  - reduced blood flow
  - intermittent claudication
  - pain at rest
  - ulcers
  - gangrene
  - extremity loss
  - raynaud's phenomenon
- physical signs of vascular damage must be present and are the primary determinants in placing the examinee into one of these categories

#### Strength (p. 507-510)

- grip & pinch strength
- manual muscle testing
- "Because strength measurements are functional tests influenced by sunjective factors that are difficult to control and the Guides for the most part is based on anatomic impairment, the Gudies does not assign a large role to such measurements." (p. 507)
- strength impairment is only provided in the "rare case" (p. 508)
- strength loss can be combined w/ other impairments "only if based on unrelated etiologic or pathomechanical causes." (p. 508)
- decreased strength cannot be rated in the presence of decreased motion, painful conditions, deformities, or absence of parts (e.g. thumb amputation) that prevent effective application of maximal force in the region being evaluated.
- "motor weakness associated with disorders of the peripheral nerve system and various degenerative neuromuscular conditions are evaluated according to guidelines described in section 16.5..." (p. 508)
- "strength can only be applied as a measure when a year or more has passed since the time of injury or surgery." (p. 508)
- "manual muscle testing of major groups is used for testing strength about the elbow and shoulder." (p. 508)
- "if there is more than 20% variation in the readings, one may assume the individual is not exerting full effort." (p. 508)
- "results of strength testing should be repoducible on different occasions or by two or more trained observers." (p. 509)
- tendinitis
  - "several syndromes involving UE are variously attributed to tendinitis, fasciitis, or epicondylitis. the most common of these are the stubborn conditions of the origins of the flexor and extensor muscle of the forearm where they attach to the medial and lateral epicondyles of the humerus. although these conditions may be persistent for some time, they are not given a permanent impairment rating unless there is some other factor that must be considered." (p. 507)
  - grip loss can be considered "if an individual has had tendon rupture or has under-gone surgical release of the flexor or extensor origins or medial or lateral epicondylitis, or has had excision of the epicondyle, there may be some permanent weakness of grip as a result fo the tendon rupture of the surgery. in this case, impairment can be given on the basis of weakness of grip strength according to section 16.8b." (p. 507)

#### "Other" Disorders (497-507)

- only used when other criteria have not adequately encompassed the impairment
- the severity of impairment due to these disorders is rated separately according to tables 16-19 through 16-30 and then multiplied by the relative maximum value fo the unit involved as specified in table 16-18 (p. 498)
- synovial hypertrophy cannot be combined with other methods: "if synovial hypertrophy is the only finding, the joint impairment is rated according to table 16-19 and multiplied by the relative maximum value of the joint involved (table 16-18). it cannot be combined with impairment due to decreased joint motion or other findings." (p. 500)
- shoulder instability
  - must be thoroughly documented: "shoulder instability, recurrent subluxation, or dislocation must be adequately documented through a complete medical history, physical examination, and radiographic findings. MRI, arthroscopy, and examination under anesthesia may be useful components of the evaluation. An individual's complaint of feeling or fearing that a joint is 'popping' or 'going out of place' without adequate clinical findings is not a basis for permanent impairment rating." (p. 504)
  - shoulder representing 60% of UE (table 16-18), the patterns of occult(10%), subluxating (20%), and disclocating (40%) instabilities represent UE impairments of 6%, 12%, and 24% respectively (p. 504)
  - shoulder instability impairment can only be combined with decreased motion impairment: "this value may be combined only with impairments due to decreased motion (section 16.4). pain and decreased muscle strength are not rated separately." (p. 504)
