# AMA Impairment Rating

## Work Comp Defense Prep

AMA Guides used to "determine impairment, the Legislature furthered its expressly stated goal of achieving 'consistency, uniformity, and objectivity'" - _Almaraz Guzman 09/03/2009_

### Almaraz Guzman

- rating not automatic
- must be substantial evidence
- within four corners of AMA Guides
- physician rationale required

### Chapter 15: The Spine

- spine structure
  - cervical (8)
  - thoracic (12)
  - lumbar (5)
  - sacrum
  - coccyx
  - motion segment = 2 adjacent vertebrae, intervertebral disc, facet joints, and ligemtous structure
- radiculopathy
  - defined as significant alteration in the function of a nerve root or nerve roots and is usually caused by pressure on one or several nerve roots
  - "diagnosis requires a dermatomal distribution of pain, numbness, and/or pareshesias in a dermatomal distribution. A root tension sign is usually positive. The diagnosis of herniated disk must be substantiated by an appropriate finding on an imaging study. The presence of findings on an imaging study in and of itself does not make the diagnosis of radiculopathy. There must also be clinical evidence" (p. 382)
  - "It is important to note that a positive imaging study in and of itself does not make the diagnosis...An imaging study alone is insufficient to qualify for a DRE category. Individuals with electromyography (EMG) studies that are clearly positive support a diagnosis of radiculopathy and therefore qualify for at least DRE caregory III." (p. 378)
  - herniated disc
  - compression fracture
- DRE method of evaluation
  - the principle methodoly used to evaluate an individual who has had a distinct injury
  - criteria
    - single level involvement
    - corticospine injury
- ROM method of evaluation
  - criteria
    - multi-level or bilateral radiculopathy
    - multi-level surgery
    - multi-level AOMSI
    - multi-level fracture
    - recurrent radiculopathy
- impairment evaluations are performed after the injured worker attains MMI
- DRE Categories
  1. subjective findings only
  2. muscle guarding, spasm/asymmetric ROM, unverified radiculopathy, resolved verified radiculopathy
  3. unresolved verified radiculopathy, spine surgery level one
  4. alteration motion segment integrity (fusion), bilateral or multi-level radiculopathy (cervical, thoracic spines)
  5. alteration motion segment integrity with radiculopathy
- symptoms, signs, & tests
  - muscle guarding
  - muscle spasm
  - asymmetry of spinal motion
  - non-verifiable radicular root pain
  - fractures
    - compression of one vertebral body
    - posterior element fracture without dislocation
    - a spinous or transverse process fracture
  - radiculopathy
    - no history of radiculopathy
    - resolved radiculopathy w/o surgery
    - resolved radiculopathy w/ surgery
    - radiculopathy at MMI
  - surgeries
  - aleration of motion segment integrity
    - fusion
    - instability - increased translational or angular motion

### ROM Method

- when to use?
  - impairment caused by illness, not specific (or CT) injury, or cause is uncertain
  - statutorily mandated
  - multilevel involvement in the same region
  - multilevel alteration of motion segment integrity (AOMSI) - fusions
- criteria
  - multi-level or bilateral radiculopathy
  - multi-level surgery
  - multi-level AOMSI
  - multi-level fracture
  - recurrent radiculopathy
- consists of 3 elements
  1. range of motion of the impaired spine region
  - two - inclinometer technique
  - physician should seek consistency
    - inconsistent results are repeated
    - disregard if results remain inconsistent
  - should match known pathology
  - at least three measurements for each motion
  - greatest measurement used for impairment
  - lumbar flexion requires sacral (hip) flexion angle -- accessory validity test -- p. 406
  - all impairments within same region are added
  2. accompanying diagnosis
  - all impairment found in table 15-7, p. 404
    - four sections (disorders), if more than one applies, use the one providing greatest impairment
    - table only used when the ROM method is used
  - always read footnotes
  - when multiple levels involved, impairment added for additional levels only
  3. spinal nerve deficit
  - motor
  - sensory
  - not always applicable; if not addressed, look for sensory or motor complaints
  - use tables on p. 424
    - tables 15-17 and 15-18 provide extremity impairment, not WPI
  - not frequently used by doctors
  - process used is similar to:
    - peripheral nerve disorders in extremities
    - strength loss in shoulder and elbow
  - nerve impairments are adjusted separately
- spinal nerve procedure
  - identify nerve(s) involved
  - determine grade/deficit (tables 15-15 and 15-16)
  - obtain maximum value (tables 15-17 and 15-18)
  - for sensory and motor deficits
    - multiply maximum value by % deficit
    - repeat for each nerve involved
    - combine all sensory impairments at extremity level
    - convert to WPI
  - adjust sensory and motor deficit separately
- combining rules for ROM method
  - may have as many as 4 WPI values
    - loss of motion
    - accompanying diagnosis
    - spinal nerve deficit - sensory
    - spinal nerve deficit - motor
  - combine loss of motion and accompanying diagnosis at WPI level, adjust
  - adjust sensory impairment
  - adjust motor impairment
  - combine

### DRE or ROM

- DRE
  - single level
  - corticospinal tract
- ROM
  - multilevel: surgery, fracture, AOMSI
  - radiculopathy that is:
    - multilevel
    - bilateral
    - recurrent

## Chapter 16: Upper Extremities

### Conversion Digit Values to Hand Value

- thumb 40%
- index 20%
- middle 20%
- ring 10%
- little 10%
- hand 100%
- conversion table 16-1 digit to hand (p. 438)

### Conversion

- 100% upper extremity (UE) = 60% WPI
- 100% hand = 90% UE = 54% WPI
- 100% thumb = 40% hand = 36% UE = 22% WPI
- 100% index/middle = 20% hand = 18% UE = 11% WPI
- 100% ring/little = 10% hand = 9% UE = 5% WPI

### 7 Methods in AMA Guide

- amputations
- digital nerve lesions
- ROM/ankylosis
- peripheral nerve disorders
- peripheral vascular disease
- strength
- "other" disorders
