## Med-Legal Obligations and Emerging Litigation

### Body of Law

- Cal Labor Code 4060: defines what med-legal expenses are
- Cal Labor Code 4061: self procured med-legal expenses
- Cal Labor Code 4622: EOR, IBR, Timeframes, and Penalties
- 8 CCR 10451.1: required timeframes, petitions, and costs/sanctions for bad faith actions or tactics

### Increasing Area of Litigation

- issue emerging at WCAB from around October 2016
- statutory penalties for failure to timely respond
- no lien filing fees/standing other than as a lien claimant
- any med-legal provider has standing position to file a petition
- potential for award costs and attorneys fees pursuant to 8 CCR 10451.1(g)

**med-legal expenses**
: cost or expense incurred by or on behalf of any party... which may include x-rays, laboratory fees, other diagnostic tests, medical reports, medical records, medical testimony, and certified interpreter (Article 8) **for the purposes of proving or disproving a contested claim** (Cal. Lab. Code 4060(a))

**contested claim**
: exists when the employer has actual or constructive knowledge an **employee is claiming entitlement to any benefit arising out of a claimed industrial injury** and one of the following conditions exists

1. benefit claimed by the employee is rejected by the employer
2. the ployer fails to admit liability for benefits after a reasonable period of time (essentially contesting the claim by not admitting liability)
3. the employer fails to respond to a demand for payment of benefits after the expiration of any time period fixed by statute for the payment of the indemnity

### "Self Procured" Med-Legal Expenses

- Labor Code § 4621 provides for reimbursement of medical legal expenses to an employee, or the dependents of a deceased employee, reasonably, actually, and necessarily incurred \[arising out of Labor Code § 4060, 4061, and 4062\]
- **BUT**.. an **employer is not liable for any med legal evaluation performed within the first 60 days of a claim being filed, absent an affirmative denial of that claim** (See Cal. Lab. Code 4621)

### Defective Med-Legal Reports/Studies

- costs of medical evaluations, diagnostic tests, and interpreters' incidental to a medical report **do not constitute medical legal expenses unless the medical report is capable of proving or disproving a disputed medical fact essential to an adjudication of the employees claim for benefits**
- only admissible med-legal evidence is subject to this statutory scheme
  > [!CAUTION]
  > beware of self procured med-legal reports pertaining to PTP recommendations/compensability of additional body parts. 20 days, or 30 days if pro per, to object. (Cal. Lab. Code 4062) see _Simmons v. State of California Dept of Mental health (2005) (70 Cal. Comp. Cases 866)_

### Cal. Labor Code 4622

- covers "all medical legal expenses for which an employer is liable"
- mandates response by way of Explanation of Review, even if expenses are denied
- mandates strict timeframes for defendant and med-legal provider
- mandates 10% penalty and 7% interest for untimely response

### Mandatory Timelines

- upon receipt by the employer of all reports and documents required by the Administrative Director incident to the services, the employer has 60 days to issue payment in full, partial payment accompanied by an EOR (defined by Cal. Lab. Code 4603.3) contesting resonableness and necessity, or by denial. **The denial must still be in the form of EOR** (see Cal. Lab. Code 4622(c))
- if the employer contests the amount paid, the provider may request a second review within 90 days. if the provider fails to do so, their bill is deemed satisfied. the request for second review must be submitted on forms prescribed by the AD and contain specified information (see Cal. Lab. Code 4622(b)(1)). **Note: This only pertains to disputes of the invoice pursuant to the fee schedule**
- if the employer denies all or a portion of the bill for reasons other than a dispute over fee schedule, **still in the form of EOR** (see Labor Code § 4603.3), the provider must object to the denial within 90 days, or the employer or employee is not liable for the amount that was denied
- **FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY TIMELINES CONSTITUTES A WAIVER OF ANY OBJECTION OTHER THAN THE AMOUNT INVOICED PURSUANT TO THE OFFICIAL FEE SCHEDULE** (see 8 CCR 10451.1(f)(1) and (f)(2))
- if provider objects to denial within 90 days:
  - the employer must file a petition and DOR within 60 days of the objection
  - 8 CCR 10451.1 (c)(2):
    > A **Defendant** shall concurrently file a "Petition for Determination of Non-IBR Medical Legal Dispute filed by a Defendant" and a Declaration of readiness to proceed shall be concurrently filed, **IF:** Defendant has denied all or a portion of a provider's med-legal billing for reasons other than disputes subject to IBR, and the defendant has objected to the partial or full denial within 90 days
- if provider responds to EOR pertaining Fee Schedule in 90 days:
  - IBR process invoked
  - payment (if additional payment ordered pursuant to Labor Code 4603.6) shall be made within 20 days of service of the order to pay
  - the WCAB has no jurisdiction over IBR!

### Jurisdiction of WCAB Over Non-IBR Med-Legal Expense Disputes

- WCAB has jurisdiction to resolve all non-IBR Med-legal Disputes and mandates duties on parties pursuant to this regulation
- Non-IBR Med-legal Disputes include, but are not limited to:
  1. any threshold issue (coverage, employment, affirmative defenses, or jurisdition)
  2. whether the claimed med-legal expense was fo rthe purpose of proving or disproving a contesting claim
  3. whether the claimed med-legal expense was reasonable and necessary
  4. an assertion defendant has waived any objection because of failure to timely comply with Labor Code § 4622, 4603.3, and 4603.6; 5
  5. an assertion the med-legal provider waived any claim because the provider failed to timely comply with Labor Code § 4622, 4603.3, and 4603.6; 5
  6. an assertion that an interpreter does not meet the criteria set forth in the Labor Code (certification)
  7. an assertion that the interpreter was not reasonably necessary
- **IBR ONLY PERTAINS TO DISPUTES REGARDING THE AMOUNT PAYABLE UNDER THE OFFICIAL FEE SCHEDULE**

### A Med-Legal Provider Does Not Have to File a Lien

- a provider **may** file a "Petition for Determination of Non-IBR Medical Legal Dispute" if defendant breaches a duty under 8 CCR 10451.1 or Labor Code § 4622 \*\*A med-legal provider is not required to file a claim of costs in the form of a lien
- the WCAB may defer hearing this issue until the issue is presented in the underlying claim, the underlying claim has been resolved by way of Compromise and Release, the underlying claim has been abandoned (**keep in mind the 7% per annum interest**)
- WCAB does not have to defer the issued set forth in the provider's "Petition for Determination of Non-IBR Medical Legal Dispute"

### Who Files Petitions and DORs and When Due

1. **Defendant** shall concurrently file a "Petition of Determination of Non-IBR Medical Legal Dispute filed by a Defendant" and a Declaration of readiness to proceed shall be concurrently filed, if defendant has denied all or a portion of a provider's med-legal billing for reasons other tha n disputes subject to IBR, and the defendant has objected to the partial or full denial within 90 days. **AND**; the DOR (and petition) MUST be filed within 60 days of receiving the objection from the med-legal provider
2. **Provider** may file a "Petition for Determination of Non-IBR Medical Legal Dispute" if defendant breaches a duty under 8 CCR 10451.1 or Labor Code § 4622

### Bad Faith Actions/Tactics by a Defendant

1. failing to pay an uncontested portion of a med-legal bill
2. failing to make a good faith effort to comply with the applicable timelines
3. contesting liability based on a dispute over injury, or injury to a particular body part
4. those actions outlined in 8 CCR 10561

**Costs, sanctions, and attorney's fees shall be in addition to penalties enumerated in Labor Code § 4622(a)(1)**

### Ripeness for Litigation

- a provider's position is that any violation of Cal. Lab. Code 4622 is a violation of 8 CCR 10451.1(g), and is bad faith per se
- a specific finding of bad faith is necessary for costs, attorneys fees, and sanctions to be awarded by the WCAB, and 8 CCR 10561 is referenced
- is there a similar standard, enumerated in 8 CCR 10561, necessary for finding of bad faith actions or tactics; OR
- does any failure to pay an uncontested amount, make a good faith effort to comply with timelines, or contesting liability due to compensability of a specific body part constitute bad faith actions or tactics?
